On October 2, 2019, the trio starred their own reality show named Boys Don't Cry, which was aired on Piki Pictures for four weeks. The show displayed their preparation before debuting, where they had to decide a name for their future group and do a street performance. === 2019–2021: Debut with Boys Da Capo and The Intersection series === On October 16, 2019, a teaser image of the trio was released, revealing "BDC" as the name of the group and their debut date. About two weeks later, on October 29, BDC released their special single album Boys Da Capo with the lead single "Remember Me", in which member Kim Si-hun participated in the choreography composition. Then, on November 24, they held their first fan meeting titled "BDC 1st FAN MEETING: REMEMBER YOU" at Yonsei University's Centennial Hall. On September 23, 2020, BDC released their first EP The Intersection: Belief with "Shoot The Moon" serving as the lead single.

On June 30, BDC released their third EP The Intersection: Contact with "Moonlight" serving as the lead single. On August 10, BDC released the special single "Moon Walker". The song, which was co-written by member Kim Sihun, was intended to be the finale or epilogue of "The Intersection" series. It was recorded at the same time as the lead single from the previous EP. On August 18, they released the single "Stop Now" which was produced by Bumkey as a part of the cyberbullying prevention campaign from the Blue Tree Foundation.

On February 15, 2023, in the first episode of the JTBC's music reality competition show Peak Time, it was revealed that BDC was one of the participants, where they went under the pseudonym Team 18:00 as it was one of the rules of the show where they had to perform under a new stage name assigned to them. On March 22, in the seventh episode of the show, BDC got eliminated on the first elimination round and their group's name was finally disclosed. The song "Thunder (Urr)", that was supposed to be performed by them on the third round of the show, was released under their actual name on the next day with other participants' songs. == Members == * Kim Si-hun () * Hong Seong-jun () * Yun Jung-hwan () == Discography == === Extended plays === List of extended plays, showing selected details, selected chart positions, and sales figures Title Details Peak chart positions Sales KOR Peak chart positions on Circle Album Chart (formerly Gaon): * Boys Da Capo: * The Intersection: Belief: * The Intersection: Discovery: * The Intersection: Contact: * Blue Sky: The Intersection: Belief * Released: September 23, 2020 * Label: Brand New Music * Formats: CD, digital download, streaming 9 * KOR: 14,416 The Intersection: Discovery * Released: March 8, 2021 * Label: Brand New Music * Formats: CD, digital download, streaming 11 * KOR: 10,210Cumulative Sales of The Intersection: Discovery: * * * * The Intersection: Contact * Released: June 30, 2021 * Label: Brand New Music * Formats: CD, digital download, streaming 13 * KOR: 9,256Cumulative Sales of The Intersection: Contact: * * === Single albums === List of single albums, showing selected details, selected chart positions, and sales figures Title Details Peak chart positions Sales KOR Boys Da Capo * Released: October 29, 2019 * Label: Brand New Music * Formats: CD, digital download, streaming 10 * KOR: 11,916 Blue Sky * Released: June 15, 2022 * Label: Brand New Music * Formats: CD, digital download, streaming 33 === Singles === Title Year Album As lead artist "Remember Me" () 2019 Boys Da Capo "Shoot the Moon" 2020 The Intersection: Belief "Moon Rider" 2021 The Intersection: Discovery "Moonlight" The Intersection: Contact "Moon Walker" "Blue Sky" () 2022 Blue Sky Promotional "Stop Now" (이제는 멈춰) 2021 ==== Collaborations ==== Title Year Album "Melting" 2019 Brandnew Year 2019 'Do That Brandnew Thing' "Chandelier" () 2020 Brandnew Year 2020 'Brandnew Up' "Hole In Your Face" (얼굴 뚫어지겠다) 2021 Ten Project Part.2 "Happy Brandnew Year" Brandnew Year 2021 'TEN: The Ever New Brandnew' "Hugs" 2022 Brandnew Year 2022 'Brandnew V1s1on' == Filmography == === Television series === Year Title Role Note(s) Ref. 2021 Let Me Be Your Knight Members of idol group Blue Moon Extra, Ep.4-5 === Television shows === Year Title Note(s) Ref. 2023 Peak Time Eliminated at the first eliminated round === Web shows === Year Title Note(s) Ref. 2019 Boys Don't Cry Pre-debut reality show == Notes == == References == Category:K-pop music groups Category:South Korean boy bands Category:South Korean dance music groups Category:Musical groups from Seoul Category:Musical groups established in 2019 Category:2019 establishments in South Korea Category:South Korean pop music groups Category:Brand New Music artists Category:Peak Time contestants
