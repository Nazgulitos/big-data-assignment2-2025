Red-Eared Slider turtles can be found sunning in the field next to the marsh. Two bald eagles have built a nest in the stand of trees west of the North Cowichan Station at the centre's lower grounds. These eagles successfully raised eaglets in 2006 after relocating from a previous nest site along the South Forester's Walk the previous summer. There are currently three eaglets in their nest. The nest is best viewed by standing at the flag pole outside the Wellburn Building at the lower grounds. ==See also== *List of heritage railways in Canada *List of museums in Canada ==References== ==External links== *Centre's website *Centre's website on Cowichan Forestry Life *Vancouver Island attractions Category:Duncan, British Columbia Category:Heritage railways in British Columbia Category:Forestry museums in Canada Category:Museums in British Columbia Category:Open-air museums in Canada Category:Railway museums in British Columbia
