In biology, the BBCH-scale for cucurbits describes the phenological development of cucurbits, such as cucumber, melon, pumpkin, marrow, squash, calabash and watermelon, using the BBCH-scale. The phenological growth stages and BBCH-identification keys of cucurbits are: Growth stage Code Description 2 digits 3 digits 0: Germination 00 000 Dry seed 01 001 Beginning of seed imbibition 03 003 Seed imbibition complete 05 005 Radicle emerged from seed 07 007 Hypocotyl with cotyledons breaking through seed coat 09 009 Emergence: cotyledons break through soil surface 1: Leaf development 10 100 Cotyledons completely unfolded 11 101 First true leaf on main stem fully unfolded 12 102 2nd true leaf on main stem unfolded 13 103 3rd true leaf on main stem unfolded 1 . 10 .
