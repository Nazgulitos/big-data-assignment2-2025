B&W; Hallerne (English: The B&W; Halls) is a former industrial complex located on the island of Refshaleøen in Copenhagen, Denmark. Built in the early 1960s by Burmeister & Wain, the complex consists of two large halls which were used to build ships until 1996. Currently, the facilities are used for culture and entertainment activities. On 2 September 2013, Danish public broadcaster DR announced that it had chosen B&W; Hallerne as the host venue for the Eurovision Song Contest 2014. The contest was held at the Section Hall 2, which was converted into a music venue with a capacity for 11,000 spectators. The surrounding buildings and areas were transformed into "Eurovision Island" which was used for additional services related to the contest. == References == == External links == *Refshaleøen's Official Website Category:Buildings and structures in Copenhagen Category:Culture in Copenhagen Category:Music venues in Copenhagen Category:Tourist attractions in Copenhagen
