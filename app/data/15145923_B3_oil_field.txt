B3 is an oil and gas field in the Baltic sea. The field is located 80 km off the Polish coastal town Rozewie. The crude oil is also referred to as Rozewie crude. The API gravity of the crude is 42-43 and sulfur content of 0.12 wt%. The jack up rig Baltic Beta located on the field takes care of processing, drilling and accommodation. The associated gas is sent through a pipeline to the heat and power generating plant in Wladyslawowo. Most of the oil produced from B3 is shipped by tanker to Gdansk and fed to the Gda≈Ñsk refinery as a small part of the refinery feedstock. == External links == * Facts about B3 and other Polish oil and gas fields * Facts about Polish oil and gas resources * Facts about B3 processing and gas export Category:Energy in Poland Category:Natural gas fields in Poland Category:Oil fields of Poland
