BAD FILM is a Japanese film directed by Sion Sono. The film, released in 2012, consists of 160 minutes of footage extracted from the original 150 hours shot in 1995 by the director. == Plot == The film revolves around the rivalry between two gangs, one Chinese, one Japanese, in Tokyo. == Background and production == The cast is mainly composed of members of Sono's art collective GAGAGA. The film was shot in HI-8, mainly in Kōenji district. == Reception == The film received generally positive reviews. A review states: "An interesting case of a belated “director’s cut” Bad Film is necessarily an imperfect beast, but perhaps all the more interesting for it." The message the film may convey, however, has been considered unclear: "This movie has some things to tell us about prejudice and xenophobia, but it's hard to say exactly what those things are. Instead, consider it a treat to just let the waves of meaningful nonsense crash over you and go along for the ride." == References == ==External links== * Category:Films directed by Sion Sono Category:Films set in Tokyo Category:Films shot in Tokyo Category:Japanese crime comedy films Category:Japanese action comedy films
