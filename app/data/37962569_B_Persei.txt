b Persei (also known as HD 26961) is a spectroscopic triple star in the constellation Perseus. Its apparent magnitude is 4.60, and it is about 320 light years away. In addition to the primary, an A-type giant, there is a smaller and cooler companion in a 1.53 day orbit, probably an F-class star around absolute magnitude 3.0, and a more distant companion (star C or Ac) in an orbit calculated to be 702 days long. The close binary pair forms a rotating ellipsoidal variable with a 1.53 day period. Star C forms an Algol- type variable system with the close binary, showing both primary eclipses (when star C passes in front of the inner pair) and secondary eclipses (when the inner pair passes in front of star C). Timings of the eclipses show a 705.4-day period. ==References== Category:Perseus (constellation) Category:A-type giants Persei, b Persei, b BD+49 1150 026961 Persei, b 020070 1324 Category:Spectroscopic binaries
