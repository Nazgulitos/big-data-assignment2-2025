The BBC Sports Team of the Year Award is an award given annually as part of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year ceremony each December. Currently, the award is given "for the team in an individual sport or sporting discipline that has achieved the most notable performance in the calendar year to date. The team should have significant UK interest or involvement". From 2012 the award's recipient is decided by an expert panel selected by the BBC. For some years before 2012 a panel of over 30 sporting journalists, each of whom voted for their top two choices and followed a defined set of voting criteria. Before that, the winner of the Team of the Year Award has been chosen by public vote and picked by listeners of Radio 5 Live. The Team of the Year Award was first presented in 1960, six years after the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award was introduced. The first recipient of the award was the Cooper Formula One Racing team. The England national rugby union team and the Ryder Cup team have won the award the most times; both teams have won five times and have shared the award on one of those occasions. Liverpool F.C. have won the award four times. The award has been shared on two occasions—by the British women's 4 x 400 m relay team and the British Ryder Cup team in 1969, and by the England national rugby union team and the British men's 4 x 400 m relay team in 1991. Teams have varied greatly in size. The smallest winning team has been two members; the figure skating duo of Torvill and Dean in 1982 and 1983, and the Olympic men's coxless rowing pair of Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent in 1992 and 1996. The largest winning team was in 2012; the British representatives at the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Six nations have been represented by the award winning team. Teams representing Great Britain have won the award the most times, having had twenty-three recipients, three of which shared the award. Excluding the 2000 British Olympic and Paralympic teams, which fielded competitors in many Paralympic and Olympic sports, the remainder of the winning teams have represented 15 sporting disciplines. Although dominated by teams from England or representing Great Britain, the award has been won twice by Scottish teams; Celtic in 1967, after they became the first British football club to win the European Cup, and the 1990 Grand Slam winning Scotland rugby union squad. Football has had the highest representation among the winners, with 15 recipients. The most recent award was presented in 2022 to the England women's national football team. == By year == BBC Sports Personality Team of the Year Award winners Year Nation Winner Sport Note 1960 Motor racing 1961 Football 1962 Motor racing 1963 Cricket 1964 Football 1965 Football 1966 Football 1967 Football 1968 Football 1969 Athletics 1969 Golf 1970 Horse racing 1971 Rugby union 1972 Equestrianism 1973 Football 1974 Rugby union 1975 Swimming (Note: Requires RealPlayer software). 1976 Athletics 1977 Football 1978 Tennis 1979 Equestrianism 1980 Rugby union 1981 Horse racing 1982 Figure skating 1983 Figure skating 1984 Equestrianism 1985 Golf 1986 Football 1987 Golf 1988 Hockey 1989 Athletics (Note: Requires RealPlayer software). 1990 Rugby union 1991 Rugby union 1991 Athletics 1992 Rowing 1993 Rugby union 1994 Rugby league 1995 Golf 1996 Rowing 1997 Rugby union 1998 Football 1999 Football 2000 — 2001 Football 2002 Golf 2003 Rugby union 2004 Rowing 2005 Cricket 2006 Rugby league 2007 Rugby union 2008 Cycling 2009 Cricket 2010 Golf 2011 Cricket 2012 — 2013 British & Irish Lions squad Rugby Union 2014 Rugby union 2015 Tennis 2016 Football 2017 Cricket 2018 Netball 2019 Cricket 2020 Football 2021 Football 2022 Football == By nation == This table lists the total number of awards won by nations that the teams have represented.
