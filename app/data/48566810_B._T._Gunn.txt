Disappearing for 2 months, Gunn would return with a much darker persona, labelled 'The Oddity', and turned his attention to Mikey Whiplash, with the pair competing in a number of brutal matches throughout the first half of the year. At Shug's Hoose Party II, Gunn defeated Whiplash, after Mikey was busted open and powerbombed onto the steel ring steps. Their feud would transform into a rivalry between the New Age Kliq, now including Wolfgang, and Legion (Mikey Whiplash, Tommy End & Michael Dante). This would lead to a 3-on-3 Steel Cage match, at Fear & Loathing VIII at the SEC Centre, with the New Age Kliq coming away with the victory thanks to Gunn. In early 2016, Gunn & Chris Renfrew were left as the only remaining members of the New Age Kliq, with Wolfgang, Kay Lee Ray & Stevie Boy defecting from the group. Turning face around the same time and dropping 'The Oddity' persona, Gunn focused much of his attention on Stevie Boy, with Stevie & Gunn competing in many singles and tag team matches throughout the year. After Stevie attempted to crush Gunn's throat with a chair, Gunn was sidelined for 3 months, before returning 'The Oddity' once again to exact revenge. This led to the first ever Casket Match in ICW history, at Fear & Loathing IX at The SSE Hydro, where Stevie would powerbomb Gunn onto the top of the casket, before picking up the victory.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=140693 On 29 July 2017, on night 1 of Shug's Hoose Party 4, Gunn competed alongside Trent Seven, Wolfgang & Pete Dunne in a Four Way match for the WWE United Kingdom Championship.

On 3 April 2018, Gunn was forced to vacate the ICW Zero-G Championship due to a double pinfall between Jody Fleisch and Mark Coffey, and interference from Whiplash. On 29 April 2018, at ICW BarraMania 4, 'The Oddity' returned to face Whiplash in the first ever ICW World Heavyweight Championship Death Match. Gunn would go on to lose the title, after 2018 Square Go winner Stevie Boy cashed in his contract mid-match, turning the contest into a Three Way, and pinned Whiplash, who had been driven through a pane of glass. Having lost both titles without being pinned, Gunn looked to climb back up the ladder. After facing and defeating Walter at night 1 of Shug's Hoose Party 5, Gunn's protege Kez Evans attacked him, claiming that Gunn had done nothing except hold him back. Kez would go on to defeat Gunn the following night. After briefly reforming the New Age Kliq to challenge the Kings Of Catch, Renfrew left the company, changing Gunn's direction and focus. After accepting an offer from Wolfgang & The Purge to join Bad Company, Gunn & Wolfgang teamed with Noam Dar to face British Strong Style at Fear & Loathing XI, with Gunn scoring the pin over Trent Seven for the win. Gunn & The Purge would then become embroiled in a feud with ICW owner Mark Dallas and his heel faction, with Dallas stating that Bad Company are not would the ICW needs in its current climate.
