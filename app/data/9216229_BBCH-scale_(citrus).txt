The BBCH-scale for citrus is a classification system used in biology to describe the phenological development of citrus plants using the BBCH-scale. The phenological growth stages and BBCH-identification keys of citrus plants are: Growth stage Code Description 0: Sprouting/Bud development 00 Dormancy: leaf and inflorescence buds undifferentiated, closed and covered by green scales 01 Beginning of bud swelling 03 End of bud swelling: green scales slightly separated 07 Beginning of bud burst 09 Green leaf tips visible 1: Leaf development 10 First leaves separating: green scales slightly open, leaves emerging 11 First leaves visibleIn Citrus the term "visible" replaces "unfolded" used for other fruit species. Leaf unfolding takes place precociously in citrus. 15 More leaves visible, not yet at full size 19 First leaves fully expanded 3: Shoot development 31 Beginning of shoot growth: axes of developing shoots visible 32 Shoots about 20% of final length 39 Shoots about 90% of final length 5: Inflorescence emergence 51 Inflorescence buds swelling: buds closed, light green scales visible 53 Bud burst: scales separated, floral tips visible 55 Flowers visible, still closed (green bud), borne on single or multiflowered leafy or leafless inflorescences 56 Flower petals elongating; sepals covering half corolla (white bud) 57 Sepals open: petal tips visible; flowers with white or purplish petals, still closed 59 Most flowers with petals forming a hollow ball 6: Flowering 60 First flowers open 61 Beginning of flowering: about 10% of flowers open 65 Full flowering: 50% of flowers open; first petals falling 67 Flowers fading: majority of petals fallen 69 End of flowering: all petals fallen 7: Development of fruit 71 Fruit set; beginning of ovary growth; beginning of fruitlets abscission 72 Green fruit surrounded by sepal crown 73 Some fruits slightly yellow: beginning of physiological fruit drop 74 Fruits about 40% of final size. Dark green fruit: end of physiological fruit drop 79 Fruits about 90% of final size 8: Maturity of fruit 81 Beginning of fruit colouring (colour-break) 83 Fruit ripe for picking; fruit has not yet developed variety-specific colour 85 Advanced ripening; increase in intensity of variety-specific colour 89 Fruit ripe for consumption; fruit has typical taste and firmness; beginning of senescence and fruit abscission 9: Senescence, beginning of dormancy 91 Shoot growth complete; foliage fully green 93 Beginning of senescence and abscission of old leaves 97 Winter dormancy period ==References== * Category:BBCH-scale
