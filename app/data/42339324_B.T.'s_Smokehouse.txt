The restaurant was founded by Brian Treitman in April 2007 in a roadside trailer next to the Brimfield Antiques Fair. After achieving initial success, B.T.’s was later expanded to occupy the 40-seat establishment that serves as the current location in Sturbridge, Massachusetts. B.T.'s has been credited in The Boston Globe as one of the “10 places to bask in barbecue”. B.T.’s started offering catering services for weddings and events in 2008. ==Management== Brian Treitman graduated from The Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York and had his internship with Ming Tsai's restaurant, Blue Ginger, in Wellesley, Massachusetts. Later he worked as a chef in various Napa County, California restaurants for more than ten years. Treitman also worked as a chef in Ken Oringer’s KO Prime in Boston before starting B.T.'s. Treitman lists Jacques Pépin and Julia Child as the chefs who were his primary influencers. The Worcester Business Journal selected Treitman as one of their "40 Under Forty" young business professionals for 2016. ==Menu== Focusing on Southern-style cuisine, the menu offers natural grass-fed beef, chicken, pork, and other meats that have been dry-rubbed and slow-smoked for up to 14 hours with local apple and hickory woods. Treitman makes his sauces and his own ketchup from scratch. In addition to standard barbecue fare, the restaurant also offers more unusual entrees such as smoked salmon, chili made with brisket meat, and smoked turkey and chicken. ==Awards and accolades== B.T.'s Smokehouse has earned numerous awards and prizes since 2007. ===Food awards=== In the fall of 2015, the British chef and restaurateur Gordon Ramsay stopped by the smokehouse for a brisket sandwich. Ramsay said he had heard about the restaurant while filming an episode of Hotel Hell in nearby Southbridge, Massachusetts, and it was recommended he stop by for a visit. Ramsay said the brisket was "perfect".Brisket quote sourced from an interview with the owner. ==Environmentalism and sustainability== The restaurant obtains much of its produce from local farms and the Pioneer Valley Growers Association. The smokehouse recycles all meat grease and vegetable oil used in the restaurant by sending the refuse to a local rendering plant. The grease from the meat is rendered into industrial soaps and cleaners, and the vegetable oil is turned into bio-diesel fuel. All of the take-out materials and cups, plates, and utensils are biodegradable. The cups are made from corn, most of the utensils are made from potato starch, and the take-out materials are made from bamboo rather than the foam material used in most barbecue restaurants. ==See also== * List of barbecue restaurants ==References== Category:Restaurants in Massachusetts Category:Barbecue restaurants in the United States Category:Restaurants established in 2007 Category:Buildings and structures in Sturbridge, Massachusetts
