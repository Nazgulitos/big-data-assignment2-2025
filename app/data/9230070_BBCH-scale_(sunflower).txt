The BBCH-scale (sunflower) identifies the phenological development stages of the sunflower (Helianthus annuus). It is a plant species specific version of the BBCH-scale. Phenological growth stages and BBCH-identification keys of sunflower Phenological growth stages and BBCH-identification keys of sunflower Code Description Principal growth stage 0: Germination Principal growth stage 0: Germination 00 Dry seed (achene) 01 Beginning of seed imbibition 03 Seed imbibition complete 05 Radicle emerged from seed 06 Radicle elongated, root hairs developing 07 Hypocotyl with cotyledons emerged from seed 08 Hypocotyl with cotyledons growing towards soil surface 09 Emergence: cotyledons emerge through soil surface Principal growth stage 1: Leaf development1 Principal growth stage 1: Leaf development1 10 Cotyledons completely unfolded 12 2 leaves (first pair) unfolded 14 4 leaves (second pair) unfolded 15 5 leaves unfolded 16 6 leaves unfolded 17 7 leaves unfolded 18 8 leaves unfolded 19 9 or more leaves unfolded Principal growth stage 3: Stem elongation Principal growth stage 3: Stem elongation 30 Beginning of stem elongation 31 1 visibly extended internode 32 2 visibly extended internodes 33 3 visibly extended internodes 3 . Stages continuous till ... 39 9 or more visibly extended internodes Principal growth stage 5: Inflorescence emergence Principal growth stage 5: Inflorescence emergence 51 Inflorescence just visible between youngest leaves 53 Inflorescence separating from youngest leaves, bracts distinguishable from foliage leaves 55 Inflorescence separated from youngest foliage leaf 57 Inflorescence clearly separated from foliage leaves 59 Ray florets visible between the bracts; inflorescence still closed Principal growth stage 6: Flowering Principal growth stage 6: Flowering 61 Beginning of flowering: ray florets extended, disc florets visible in outer third of inflorescence 63 Disc florets in outer third of inflorescence in bloom (stamens and stigmata visible) 65 Full flowering: disc florets in middle third of inflorescence in bloom (stames and stigmata visible) 67 Flowering declining: disc florets in inner third of inflorescence in bloom (stames and stigmata visible) 69 End of flowering: most disc florets have finished flowering, ray florets dry or fallen Principal growth stage 7: Development of fruit Principal growth stage 7: Development of fruit 71 Seeds on outer edge of the inflorescence are grey and have reached final size 73 Seeds on outer third of the inflorescence are grey and have reached final size 75 Seeds on middle third of the inflorescence are grey and have reached final size 79 Seeds on inner third of the inflorescence are grey and have reached final size Principal growth stage 8: Ripening Principal growth stage 8: Ripening 80 Beginning of ripening: seeds on outer third of anthocarp black and hard. Back of anthocarp still green 81 Seeds on outer third of anthocarp dark and hard. Back of anthocarp still green 83 Dark of anthocarp yellowish-green, bracts still green. Seeds about 50% dry matter 85 Seeds on middle third of anthocarp dark and hard. Back of anthocarp yellow, bracts brown edged. Seeds about 60% dry matter 87 Physiological ripeness: back of the anthocarp yellow. Bracts marbled brown. Seeds about 75â€“80% dry matter 89 Fully ripe: seeds on inner third of anthocarp dark and hard. Back of anthocarp brown. Bracts brown. Seeds about 85% dry matter Principal growth stage 9: Principal growth stage 9: 92 Over ripe, seeds over 90% dry matter 97 Plant dead and dry 99 Harvested product 1 Stem elongation may occur earlier than stage 19; in this case continue with the principal stage 3 ==References== * * ==External links== *A downloadable version of the BBCH Scales Category:BBCH-scale
