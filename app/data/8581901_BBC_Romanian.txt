BBC Romanian was the Romanian branch of the BBC World Service (Radio) for Romania and Moldova. Since 2004, it broadcast on its own frequency (only in Bucharest - 88 FM, Chişinău - 97,2 FM, Timișoara - 93,9 FM and Constanţa - 96,9 FM); until then its signal was re-broadcast by local radio stations, partners of BBC Romanian. On 25 June 2008, the BBC announced that it would close its Romanian language service after 69 years of broadcasting, effective 1 August 2008. ==See also== *BBC Radio *BBC World Service ==References== ==External links== *BBC Romanian in Moldova *BBC Romanian in Romania Romanian Category:Romanian-language radio stations Category:Romania–United Kingdom relations Category:2008 disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:Moldova–United Kingdom relations Category:Radio stations established in 1939 Category:1939 establishments in the United Kingdom
