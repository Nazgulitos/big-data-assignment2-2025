In September 2010 BAE Systems has been awarded a $629 million contract from the U.S. MRAP Joint Program Office to upgrade 1,700 Caiman MRAP vehicles to Caiman Multi-Terrain Vehicle - Caiman MTV standard. The upgraded vehicle integrates a refurbished and improved armored capsule from an existing vehicle with a new high-power automotive power train, chassis and independent suspension made by ArvinMeritor. Greater survivability is achieved through an enhanced monolithic floor, a strengthened chassis frame and better blast absorbing seats. On December 18, 2011, a Caiman was part of the last U.S. military convoy out of Iraq, being the last vehicle to cross the border into Kuwait, signifying the end of U.S. military presence and operations in the eight-year Iraq War. Starting in October 2013, local police and sheriff offices in the U.S. began to acquire Caiman 6x6 MTVs. The U.S. government offered these vehicles to local law enforcement as the need for them greatly decreased after the Iraq and Afghanistan wars ended. The Caiman MTV normally costs $412,000, but is sold for only its transportation costs to the local jurisdiction.United States Northwest Regional SWAT Team is now equipped with Caiman 6x6 MRAP vehicle - Armyrecognition.com, 3 November 2013 In September 2014, the U.S. approved a $2.5 billion deal with the United Arab Emirates Army for over 4,500 surplus U.S. MRAPs for increased force protection, conducting humanitarian assistance operations, and protecting vital international commercial trade routes and critical infrastructure. 1,150 vehicles were Caimans.United States approved major contract of MRAP vehicles for UAE - Armyrecognition.com, 27 September 2014 ==Operators== thumb|400px|Map with military BAE Caiman operators in blue ===Military operators=== * : Egyptian Armed Forces — 400 * : Iraqi Special Operations Forces * : Libyan National Army * : Nigerian Army — part of a batch of 24 MRAPs * : United Arab Emirates Army — 1,150 * : United States Armed Forces ===Civilian operators=== * : NASA and several law enforcement agencies ===Non-state operators=== * People's Defense Units (YPG) ==See also== * Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) ==References== Category:BAE Systems land vehicles Category:Wheeled armoured fighting vehicles Category:Military vehicles introduced in the 2000s Category:Wheeled armoured personnel carriers Category:Six-wheeled vehicles
