During its early years nearly thirty musicians played with the band. B.T.R. played live for the first time at a rock festival in Troyan, Bulgaria in 1990. In their first album, the band consisted of Hristo Angov (vocals), Valentine Guevski (guitar), Kiril Bozhkov (guitar), Ivan Kalfov (bass), and Georgi Milev (drums). Their first album was released by Riva Sound as a live album, with a performance which took place at the Valentin Andreev Hall on January 29,1992. In 1993 B.T.R. released their first studio album, "Bending the Rules". The album consisted of powerful heavy metal tracks and melodic ballads. It was distributed by Unison - RTM and became one of Bulgaria's best- selling albums in 1993. === New members & International Success (1993 - 2004) === Since 1993 B.T.R. consisted of Kiril Bojkov (guitar), Ivan Kalfov (vocals, bass guitar), Ilian Dikov (drums), Slavcho Nikolov (guitar, vocals) and Atanas "Nasko" Penev (vocals). Their first album with this lineup was "Feel the Life" and it consisted of traditional heavy metal tracks. Following extensive promotion in small clubs and concert halls, the band made an impression in France and had positive reception amongst the French fans. B.T.R.'s arrival in Nice coincided with the soccer victory of Bulgaria over France, and the band was later invited to play soccer with the semi-professional University of Nice soccer team. In 1994 the band was invited to play in F.R.A.C.A, a large musical forum in Southern France in which over 20 bands perform. A year later, the band opened for Iron Maiden in Sofia. === Mainstream success === In 1997, "B.T.R. '97" was released, which was a significant step forward for the band. The album was actually recorded in 1996, but not released until a year after. Amongst the songs was perhaps one of B.T.R.'s most recognized songs, "Elmaz i Staklo" (Diamond and Glass). Following the critical success of "'97", the band was again invited to perform in the French festival "Cosmopoliten", featuring various international acts. left|thumb|200px|B.T.R.'s 7 Ballads is one of their best-selling albums1998 marked the release of the hit single Salvation, their most acclaimed song to date.
