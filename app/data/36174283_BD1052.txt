BD1052 or N-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-N-2-propen-1-yl-1-pyrrolidineethanamine is a selective sigma receptor agonist, with a reported binding affinity of Ki = 2 Â± 0.5 nM for the sigma-1 receptor and 30 times selectivity over the sigma-2 receptor. Consistent with other reported sigma receptor agonists, pretreating Swiss Webster mice with BD1052 significantly increases the behavioral toxicity of cocaine. ==See also== * BD1008 * BD1031 * LR132 ==References== Category:Sigma agonists Category:Chloroarenes Category:Pyrrolidines Category:Allyl compounds
