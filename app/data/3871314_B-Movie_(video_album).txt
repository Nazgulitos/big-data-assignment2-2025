B-Movie is a DVD released by MxPx in 2004. It is a combination of live concert footage and a documentary of the band. The concert footage is culled from a three-night stint in late 2003 at El Corazon in Seattle (at the time, still called The Graceland). It also features a five-track acoustic EP called The AC/EP. == DVD == Although the band recorded three full nights of shows for the DVD, only 5 song performances actually appear on the DVD.
