BBC v Hearn [1977] ICR 686 is a UK labour law case, concerning collective action and the scope of a "trade dispute" under what is now TULRCA 1992 section 244. ==Facts== The BBC wanted an injunction to restrain Hearn and the Association of Broadcasting Staff from stopping broadcast of the 1977 FA Cup Final. ABS objected to transmission unless the BBC agreed to not broadcast to South Africa. In the High Court, Pain J held that the proposed action was in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute. ==Judgment== Lord Denning MR held that the injunction was to be granted, because it was not strictly a dispute over terms and conditions of work. ==See also== *UK labour law *Hadmor Productions Ltd v Hamilton [1983] 1 AC 191 at 227, 233â€“234, approving Hearn *Re P (a minor) [2003] UKHL 8 ==Notes== ==References== * Category:United Kingdom labour case law
