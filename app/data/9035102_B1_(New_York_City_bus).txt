The company was later leased by the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation. In 1929 the company made a subsidiary company, the Brooklyn and Queens Transit Corporation, to run multiple Streetcar lines one of which was the 86th Streetcar Line. The line ran entirely on surface level except for the northern terminal where it went onto an island platform. The 86th Streetcar Line had connections to multiple lines including the Bay Ridge Line, West End Line and the Fifth Avenue Line. In 1930, new tracks were made that split from the West End Line at 24th Avenue and went onto a right of way path used by trolleys to get to the Unionville Depot and onto Crospey Avenue. The 86th Street line would then later merge back with the West End Line at the intersection of Crospey and Stillwell Avenues. The 86th Street streetcar line closed on August 12, 1948, was replaced with bus service and demolished some time later. ===Pre-1930 Stations list=== Neighborhood Station Type Tracks Services Opened Transfers and notes Bay Ridge Bay Ridge 65th Street Terminal Station local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Bay Ridge Ramp down from elevated station Ramp down from elevated station Ramp down from elevated station Ramp down from elevated station Ramp down from elevated station Ramp down from elevated station Bay Ridge 67th Street local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Bay Ridge Bay Ridge Avenue local all 86th Street Line 1894 Transfer to Bay Ridge Avenue line Bay Ridge 4th Avenue local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Bay Ridge 5th Avenue local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Bay Ridge 72nd Street local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Bay Ridge Bay Ridge Parkway local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Bay Ridge 77th Street local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Bay Ridge 80th Street local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Bay Ridge 83rd Street local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Bay Ridge Fifth Avenue local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Bay Ridge Fort Hamilton Parkway local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Dyker Heights Dyker Heights 7th Avenue local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Dyker Heights 12th Avenue local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Dyker Heights 14th Avenue-86th Street local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Dyker Heights Benson Avenue local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Dyker Heights 14th Avenue local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Bath Beach Bath Beach 15th Avenue local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Bath Beach 16th Avenue local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Bath Beach 17th Avenue local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Bath Beach Tracks Merge at Bay 19th Street with the West End Line Tracks Merge at Bay 19th Street with the West End Line Tracks Merge at Bay 19th Street with the West End Line Tracks Merge at Bay 19th Street with the West End Line Tracks Merge at Bay 19th Street with the West End Line Tracks Merge at Bay 19th Street with the West End Line Bath Beach Bay 18th Street local all 86th Street Line 1894 Connections to the West End Line surface Bath Beach 20th Avenue local all 86th Street Line 1894 Connections to the West End Line surface Bath Beach 21st Avenue local all 86th Street Line 1894 Connections to the West End Line surface Bath Beach Bay Parkway local all 86th Street Line 1894 Connections to the West End Line surface Bath Beach 23rd Avenue local all 86th Street Line 1894 Connections to the West End Line surface Bath Beach 24th Avenue local all 86th Street Line 1894 Connections to the West End Line surface Bath Beach 25th Avenue local all 86th Street Line 1894 Connections to the West End Line surface Bath Beach Track Splits to Unionville Depot Track Splits to Unionville Depot Track Splits to Unionville Depot Track Splits to Unionville Depot Track Splits to Unionville Depot Track Splits to Unionville Depot Bath Beach Bay 41st Street local all 86th Street Line 1894 Connections to the West End Line surface Bath Beach Bay 44th Street local all 86th Street Line 1894 Connections to the West End Line surface Gravesend Gravesend 28th Avenue local all 86th Street Line 1894 Connections to the West End Line surface Gravesend Harway Avenue local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Gravesend Avenue Z local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Coney Island Coney Island Neptune Avenue local all 86th Street Line 1894 Demolished 1948 Coney Island Stillwell Avenue local all 86th Street Line 1894 Connections to the West End Line surface, Sea Gate, Norton's Point and Sea Beach Line (As of 1948) ===Bus line=== Bus service in the Sheepshead Bay area was started in April 1919 by Plum Beach Auto Stage. Trolley service had not reached the area, due to its sparse population. It was one of the first bus routes in Brooklyn. Initially, the routes were lettered A, B, and C. They were feeder routes for elevated trains. Between 1936 and around 1940, a branch of the B1 was extended from Brighton Beach Avenue and Ocean Avenue to Coney Island Hospital. Another branch of the B1 that operated from Bragg Street and Emmons Avenue and making a loop between Avenues X and Y between Coney Island Avenue and Ocean Avenue was rerouted and extended south to Coney Island Hospital. When the B2 (later renumbered the B32) started from Avenue U to the foot of Flatbush Avenue, The prefix 1 was added to routes A, B, and C. In 1946, the B1A and B1B branches were combined to form the B21 making a U-shaped route. The 86th Street portion and Bay Ridge Avenue portion of the B1 (west of 25th Avenue) were B34 until 1978. Service via Brighton Beach was the B21 bus until 1978. Service originally ran via the Sheepshead Bay (BMT Brighton Line) station. Service was rerouted via Brighton Beach and Coney Island Hospital in 1978, absorbing the B21 and B34. The current routing was originally proposed in the 1970s as the B86. The western end (13th Avenue and 86th Street) was swapped with the B64 in 2010. On December 1, 2022, the MTA released a draft redesign of the Brooklyn bus network. As part of the redesign, the B1 would retain its route, but closely spaced stops would be eliminated. ==References== B001 001
