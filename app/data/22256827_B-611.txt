The B-611 is a Chinese solid-fuelled short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) developed by China Precision Machinery Import-Export Corporation (CPMIEC). The missile has a maximum range of . The B-611 development began development in 1995, and first shown in 2004. A newer variant was shown in late 2006. The B-611 was sold to Turkey via technology transfer. Further developed into the J-600T Yıldırım and Bora missiles. ==Variants== ===B611=== Basic variant, with a range of and a warhead. ====B611M==== Upgraded variant of the B-611, with a warhead and a range of . ====B611MR==== The B611MR is a semi-ballistic surface-launched anti-radiation missile first advertised in 2014. It uses GPS- inertial guidance and wideband passive radar. The missile is capable of flying flattened trajectory and performing pre-programmed maneuvers to reduce the chance of interception. ===P-12=== The P-12 is a variant of the B-611. The P-12 has a longer strake, and is believed to be lighter than the B-611 and carry a HE fragmentation or blast warhead. A pair of the missiles may be carried inside a 6×6 wheeled vehicle. The P-12 was first shown at the 2006 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition. ====BP-12==== The BP-12 is a variant that has satellite guidance, and is considered the first member of the family to branch out from the B-611. ====BP-12A==== The BP-12A is similar to the Type 631, with an estimated range of and a warhead. The missile can be integrated into the SY-400 missile launcher. ====CM-401==== CM-401 is a hypersonic anti-ship ballistic missile developed by the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC), with a range of up to and terminal active radar homing guidance. ====BP-12B==== Latest variant, exhibited at the 2016 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition. It uses radar or infrared homing and can hit slow moving targets like ships. ===SY-300=== SY-300 is a development of WS-2/3, with SY standing for Shen Ying (神鹰 meaning 'Divine Eagle'), designed after the 4th Academy and the 9th Academy of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) were merged to form a new 4th Academy. The main difference between the SY-300 and its WS-2/3 predecessor is that for WS-2/3, the control section of the forward control surfaces and the warhead are integrated into a single unit, but they are separated in SY-300. This design difference enables the guidance system of SY-300 to be rapidly changed in the field by soldiers, by simply replacing the guidance system with a dummy weight, when SY-300 needs to be used as an unguided rocket. Each vehicle can carry either six or twelve SY-300 rockets. ====SY-400==== SY-400 is a further development of SY-300 that can carry either two BP-12A short-range ballistic missiles with a range of or eight 400 mm rockets. It was briefly displayed for the first time at the 2008 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition. As a low cost alternative to more expensive ballistic missiles, the accuracy of SY-400 is increased by adding GPS to correct the cascade inertial navigational guidance, and according to the developer, the accuracy can be further improved if military grade GPS signals are used to replacing the existing civilian GPS signal. Another feature of SY-400 is that it shares the same launching vehicle and fire control system of BP-12A ballistic missile, thus simplifying logistics. ==Operators== thumb|400px|Map with B-611 operators in blue ===Current operators=== * *: BP-12A (SY-400) *: 8+ BP-12A (CH-SS-14 mod 2) as of 2022.
