B, S & T; 4 (also expanded as Blood, Sweat & Tears; 4) is the fourth album by the band Blood, Sweat & Tears, released in June 1971. It peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Pop albums chart. The band invited former member Al Kooper to contribute the song "John the Baptist (Holy John)." Trombonist Dave Bargeron replaced Jerry Hyman. David Clayton-Thomas left as lead vocalist to pursue a solo career after the release of B, S & T; 4, as did founding members Dick Halligan and Fred Lipsius. Clayton-Thomas would return to the lineup for 1975's New City. ==Reception== Writing for Allmusic, critic William Ruhlman wrote "the band's cohesion seemed to be disintegrating. Although the album scraped the Top Ten briefly and went gold, it marked the end of BS&T;'s period of wide commercial success on records." ==Track listing== #"Go Down Gamblin'" (David Clayton-Thomas) – 4:14 #"Cowboys and Indians" (Dick Halligan, Terry Kirkman) – 3:07 #"John the Baptist (Holy John)" (Al Kooper, Phyllis Major) – 3:35 #"Redemption" (Halligan, Clayton-Thomas) – 5:11 #"Lisa, Listen to Me" (Halligan, Clayton-Thomas) – 2:58 #"A Look to My Heart" (Fred Lipsius) – 0:52 #"High on a Mountain" (Steve Katz) – 3:13 #"Valentine's Day" (Katz) – 3:56 #"Take Me in Your Arms (Rock Me a Little While)" (Holland-Dozier-Holland) – 3:27 #"For My Lady" (Katz) – 3:23 #"Mama Gets High" (Dave Bargeron, Katz) – 4:09 #"A Look to My Heart" (Lipsius) – 2:07 ==Personnel== *David Clayton- Thomas - lead vocals except as noted; guitar on "Go Down Gamblin'" *Steve Katz - electric guitar, acoustic guitar, harmonica, mandolin; lead vocals on "Valentine's Day" *Jim Fielder - bass; guitar on "Redemption" *Dick Halligan - organ, piano, flute, trombone *Fred Lipsius - alto saxophone, piano, organ, clarinet *Dave Bargeron - trombone, tuba, bass trombone, baritone horn, acoustic bass *Lew Soloff - trumpet, flugelhorn, piccolo trumpet *Chuck Winfield - trumpet, flugelhorn *Bobby Colomby - drums, percussion Additional musicians *Don Heckman - clarinet, bass clarinet ("Valentine's Day" and "For My Lady") *Michael Smith - congas ("Redemption") ==Production== *Producers: Don Heckman, Bobby Colomby, Roy Halee *Engineers: Roy Halee, Lou Waxman *Arrangers: Dave Bargeron, David Clayton-Thomas, Jim Fielder, Dick Halligan, Al Kooper, Fred Lipsius *Design and Photography: Norman Seeff ==Charts== Album - Billboard (United States) Year Chart Position 1971 Pop Albums 10 Singles - Billboard (United States) Year Single Chart Position 1971 "Go Down Gamblin'" (2:45 edit) Pop Singles 32 1971 "Lisa, Listen To Me" Pop Singles 73 ==References== Category:Blood, Sweat & Tears albums Category:1971 albums Category:Albums produced by Roy Halee Category:Columbia Records albums Category:Albums produced by Bobby Colomby
