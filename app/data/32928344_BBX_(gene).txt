HMG box transcription factor BBX also known as bobby sox homolog or HMG box- containing protein 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the BBX gene. ==Model organisms== Bbx knockout mouse phenotype Characteristic Phenotype Homozygote viability Normal Fertility Normal Body weight Normal Anxiety Normal Neurological assessment Normal Grip strength Normal Hot plate Normal Dysmorphology Normal Indirect calorimetry Normal Glucose tolerance test Normal Auditory brainstem response Normal DEXA Abnormal Radiography Abnormal Body temperature Normal Eye morphology Normal Clinical chemistry Normal Plasma immunoglobulins Abnormal Haematology Normal Peripheral blood lymphocytes Normal Micronucleus test Normal Heart weight Abnormal Tail epidermis wholemount Normal Skin Histopathology Normal Brain histopathology Normal Salmonella infection Normal Citrobacter infection Normal All tests and analysis fromMouse Resources Portal, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. All tests and analysis fromMouse Resources Portal, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Model organisms have been used in the study of BBX function. A conditional knockout mouse line, called Bbxtm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi was generated as part of the International Knockout Mouse Consortium program, a high-throughput mutagenesis project to generate and distribute animal models of disease to interested scientists. Male and female animals underwent a standardized phenotypic screen to determine the effects of deletion. Twenty six tests were carried out on homozygous mutant adult mice and four significant abnormalities were observed. A study of body composition found decreases in bone mineral density and content, and a reduction in body length in female mice, while mutants of both sexes showed a reduction in lean body mass. Radiography found that males had abnormal teeth morphology. Females had a decreased heart weight, and both sexes had reduced IgA levels in their plasma. == References == ==External links== * ==Further reading == * * * * * * Category:Transcription factors Category:Genes mutated in mice
