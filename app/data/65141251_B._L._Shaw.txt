Bernice Lorene Shaw (also known as B. L. "Buddy" Shaw; September 6, 1933 - January 18, 2018), was a Louisiana educator and politician who served in the Louisiana State Senate. Shaw died early in 2018 at the age of eighty-four, and was interred at Providence Cemetery in Ringgold, Louisiana. Caddo Parish School Superintendent T. Lamar Goree described Shaw as "undoubtedly a legend in our district and a man who set C. E. Byrd apart from the crowd. He was a career educator who loved the students of this district and spent his life in service to the community. ... his legacy will long be remembered." } == References == Category:1933 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Republican Party members of the Louisiana House of Representatives Category:Republican Party Louisiana state senators Category:Politicians from Shreveport, Louisiana Category:Baptists from Louisiana Category:Northwestern State University alumni Category:Louisiana State University alumni Category:Schoolteachers from Louisiana Category:American school principals Category:School board members in Louisiana Category:United States Army soldiers Category:Burials in Louisiana Category:20th-century Baptists
