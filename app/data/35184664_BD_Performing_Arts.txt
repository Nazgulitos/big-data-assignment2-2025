They reorganized the unit as The Blue Devils, taking the name from the V.F.W.'s color (blue) and a local landmark, Mt. Diablo (devil). In its first season, the group performed as an all-boy drum corps with an all-girl drill team. In 1958, the Blue Devils added glockenspiels, becoming a drum and bell corps, while the girls became a separate a baton twirling troupe, the Majorettes. In 1961, the Blue Devils added a flag section to the unit that was then competing in the state's Junior division. Jerry Seawright succeeded Tony Odello as corps manager in 1964. In 1968, the drum and bell corps moved into Senior Division competition, becoming the Blue Devils "A" corps, and a new Blue Devils "B" Junior corps was begun. With all units of the Blue Devils organization enjoying success, the decision was made to transform the "A" drum and bell corps into a drum and bugle corps (D&B;). In 1970, a group of ten buglers was added to the Blue Devils drums and flags, and the corps entered its first competition as the Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps. In 1972, the unit advanced from Class B competition to Class A and made its first trip on tour outside California, competing in the Pacific Northwest. In 1973 the organization incorporated as the Blue Devils Parents Association, a California non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation, and that summer, the Blue Devils "A" corp made its first national tour, concluding with its first appearance at the Drum Corps International World Championships in Whitewater, Wisconsin, where the corps finished 24th of 48 corps and earned Associate membership in DCI. Also in 1973, the Junior drum and bell corps became the Blue Devils B D&B; Corps and the younger Blue Devils C D&B; Corps was formed. In 1974, the Blue Devils finished in 9th place at the DCI Championships; in 1975, advanced to 3rd place; and in 1976, won the first of the corps' record 19 DCI World Championship titles. Since 1991, the corps has been under the direction of Dave Gibbs, a former marching member and drum major. In 2009, the Blue Devils "B" corps won the first of 5 successive DCI Open Class World Championships.Drum Corps World, June 17, 1988Drum Corps World, January, 2003Drum Corps World, August 6, 2004A History of Drum & Bugle Corps, Vol. 2; Steve Vickers, ed.; Drum Corps World, pub.; 2003 In 2008 the Board of Directors officially changed the name of the organization from the Blue Devils Parents Association to BD Performing Arts in order to more accurately reflect 1) the new corporate governance structure, and 2) a more encompassing name. ==Sponsored Units== Among the programs sponsored by BD Performing Arts are: *The Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps (also known as the Blue Devils "A" Corps)- an internationally competitive drum and bugle corps founded in 1957 having 150 members between the ages of 17 and 21.

In 2009, The Concord Blue Devils went undefeated and won their 13th World Championship with a record score (for the corps) of 99.05. This was also the first time an organization won both World and Open Class Championships with the Blue Devils B also going undefeated and winning their 1st World Championship. In 2010, The Concord Blue Devils and Blue Devils B repeated their 2009 feat by once again winning the World and Open Class championships and the A corps completing back-to-back undefeated seasons, a first in DCI history. The B corps only lost one show in 2010. In 2011, Blue Devils "B" repeated for a third straight year as Open Class World Champions, narrowly beating the Oregon Crusaders. The Crusaders beat BDB only days before the finals, providing their only loss of the season. In a changed format that year, Blue Devils "B" went on to place 19th at the World Class semifinals, beating out five World Class Corps (Jersey Surf, Cascades, Teal Sound, Mandarins, and Pioneer). Note A: The 1999 Precision West show counted only as an exhibition show due to the city losing power halfway through the Blue Devils performance after the Santa Clara Vanguard had performed first. This show is unofficially referred to as the "Lights Out Show" and is considered by some to be one of the loudest and longest standing ovations in DCI history, given as a result of the members not stopping their performance when the lights went out. The power failed about a minute into the ballad section of the show, and the members continued to play and march to the end of the show in very dim and fading light. Many of the members in the corps feel that the "Lights Out Show" was a turning point for them, and that it had bonded the corps, eventually leading them to winning their 10th DCI World Championship. Note B: The Blue Devils B-Corps won the DCI Open-Class Championship title for three consecutive years: 2009, 2010, and 2011, giving the organization another championship "Three-peat", the first for one of the organizations' drum corps. The Blue Devils Winter Guard won the Winter Guard International Independent World Championship from 1995 through 1998. The Twirling Corps won 6 National Corps and 12 National Team championships between 1977 and 1997. ==References== ==External links== *Blue Devils website *Drum Corps International *Winter Guard International Category:Arts organizations based in California Category:Culture of Concord, California Category:Organizations based in Contra Costa County, California Category:Drum and bugle corps Category:Drum Corps International World Class corps Category:Drum Corps International Open Class corps Category:Music of the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Non-profit organizations based in California ja:ブルーデビルス
