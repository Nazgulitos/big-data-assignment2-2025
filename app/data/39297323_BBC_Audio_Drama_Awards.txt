The BBC Audio Drama Awards is an awards ceremony created by BBC Radio to recognise excellence in the radio industry, in particular in audio dramas. The inaugural awards were presented in 2012 and the ceremony hosted at the BBC Radio Theatre, Broadcasting House where it has remained ever since. The awards were first announced with an invitation for entries on 24 October 2011, and the shortlisted nominees revealed on 10 January 2012. The inaugural ceremony took place on 29 January 2012 and proved hugely successful. Prior to this, there was no official awards ceremony to recognise audio dramas; the Sony Radio Academy Awards mainly encompassed radio shows and presenters while the Richard Imison Award (for best original script by a new writer) and Tinniswood Award (for best audio drama script of the year) were awarded separately. The Imison and Tinniswood Awards are now incorporated into the Audio Drama Awards, the former administered by the Society of Authors and the latter by both the Society of Authors and the Writers' Guild of Great Britain. ==Nominations and judges== Although nominations are dominated by the BBC's in-house arts- oriented stations, particularly BBC Radio 3 and BBC Radio 4, entries are open to all makers of audio drama world-wide. The judges include personalities from both the radio, acting and theatre industry and the literary world. Notable judges have included British dramatist Nell Leyshon, American novelist Stephen Wright, performance historian Viv Gardner, English actor Robert Bathurst, long-time producer and Director-General of the BBC Lord Hall, comedian Alexei Sayle, actress Imogen Stubbs and Royal Shakespeare Company associate director Rupert Goold. ==Winners== ===2023=== The ceremony took place on 19 March 2023 and covered audio dramas broadcast between 1 October 2021 and 31 October 2022 or first uploaded / published / released for free listening online during the same period. 2023 marked the centenary of the audio and radio drama genre at the BBC. 12th annual awards – Host: Award Winner Other finalists Lifetime Achievement Martin Jarvis OBE – Outstanding Contribution Radio Drama Company, 1923–2023 – Best Actor Anton Lesser (One Five Seven Years) Director: Nicolas Jackson (Afonica for BBC Radio 4 & BBC Sounds) * Alfred Enoch (Darkness) Director: Nadia Molinari (BBC Audio Drama North) * Toby Jones (The Miser) Director: Emma Harding (BBC Cymru Wales) Best Actress Mary Murray (The Pride of Parnell Street) Director: Jim Culleton (BBC Audio Drama London for BBC Radio 3) * Ruth Everett (Spice) Director: Toby Swift (BBC Audio Drama London) * Danielle Vitalis (Faith, Hope and Glory) Director: Anastasia Osei-Kuffour (BBC Audio Drama London) Best Supporting Performance Matthew Gravelle (Fault Lines: Blood) Director: Gary Brown (BBC Audio Drama North for BBC Radio 4) * Conleth Hill (Dead Hand) Director: Michael Shannon (BBC Northern Ireland) * Commendation: Josie Lawrence (Thanks a Lot, Milton Jones!)
