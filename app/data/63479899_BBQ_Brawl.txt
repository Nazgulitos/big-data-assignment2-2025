BBQ Brawl (titled BBQ Brawl: Flay V. Symon during the first season) is an American cooking competition television series that airs on Food Network. ==Production== The first three seasons were filmed at the Star Hill Ranch in Austin, Texas, while the fourth season was filmed in California. The first season aired from August 1 to August 22, 2019; and it was presented by chefs Bobby Flay and Michael Symon. Chefs Moe Cason, Chris Lilly and Amy Mills served as judges. It began with eight barbecue chefs in the pilot episode, who were then divided into two teams that were each headed by Flay and Symon. At the end of each episode, one chef from each team was eliminated. The winner in the season finale was awarded the title "Master of 'Cue", which was in turn the name of their subsequent series on FoodNetwork.com. The second season added chef and former football player Eddie Jackson as a host alongside Flay and Symon. Chefs Rodney Scott and Brooke Williamson were added in as the new judges along with television personality Carson Kressley. It aired from June 14 to August 9, 2021. The third season consisting of eight episodes brought in chefs Jet Tila and Anne Burrell as new hosts, serving as mentors alongside Flay. It aired from May 9 to June 27, 2022. In April 2023 Symon revealed that the show was filming a fourth season, but he would not be returning. In June 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that it would premiere on July 10, 2023 with a 90-minute special episode and Sunny Anderson would serve as a mentor alongside Flay and Burrell. ==Contestants== ===Season 1=== ====Winner==== * Lee Ann Whippen - Tampa, Florida ====Runner-up==== * Susie Bulloch - Lehi, Utah ====Eliminated==== : * Joe Pearce - Kansas City, Missouri * Kevin Bludso - Compton, California * Carey Bringle - Nashville, Tennessee * George "Tuffy" Stone - Richmond, Virginia * Phil Johnson - Phoenix, Arizona * Lynnae Oxley- Loupe - Battle Ground, Washington ===Season 2=== ===Season 3=== == Contestant progress == ===Season 1=== Rank Contestant Episode Episode Episode Episode Rank Contestant 1 2 3 4 1 Lee Ann IN BTM IN WINNER 2 Susie IN IN IN RUNNER-UP 3 Lynnae IN BTM OUT 4 Phil IN IN OUT 5 Tuffy BTM OUT 6 Carey BTM OUT 7 Kevin OUT 8 Joe OUT : (WINNER) This contestant won the competition and was crowned "Master of 'Cue". : (RUNNER-UP) The contestant was the runner-up in the finals of the competition. : (BTM) The contestant was selected as one of the bottom entries on their team, but was not eliminated. : (OUT) The contestant was eliminated from the competition. ===Season 2=== ===Season 3=== ==Episodes== === Season 1 (2019) === No. Title Original air date Rating (18-49) Viewers (millions) 1 "Backyard BBQ" 0.3 1.00 2 "High Steaks" 0.2 0.94 3 "Winging It" 0.2 0.82 4 "Going Whole Hog" 0.2 1.03 === Season 2 (2021) === No. Title Original air date Rating (18-49) Viewers (millions) DVR (18-49) DVR viewers (millions) Total (18-49) Total viewers (millions) 1 "Introduce Your 'Cue" 0.2 0.95 0.1 0.31 0.3 1.26 2 "Hometown Favorites" 0.2 0.97 0.1 0.27 0.3 1.24 3 "BBQ Hacks" 0.2 0.80 0.1 0.31 0.3 1.11 4 "Game Day BBQ" 0.2 0.89 0.1 0.30 0.2 1.19 5 "Competition 'Cue" 0.2 0.78 0.1 0.38 0.2 1.16 6 "BBQ Brunch Battle" 0.2 0.99 0.1 0.34 0.3 1.32 7 "Seafood Showdown" 0.2 0.68 — — — — 8 "BBQ Around the World" 0.2 0.72 — — — — 9 "Future 'Cue" 0.2 0.89 0.1 0.31 0.2 1.20 10 "Master of 'Cue" 0.2 0.81 0.1 0.33 0.2 1.13 === Season 3 (2022) === No. Title Original air date Rating (18-49) Viewers (millions) 1 " 'Cue the Introductions " 0.2 0.88 2 "BBQ Games" 0.2 0.87 3 "Backyard BBQ" 0.2 0.95 4 "Throwback BBQ" 0.2 0.83 5 "You Gotta Beef with Me?!" 0.2 0.93 6 "Not Your Average 'Cue" 0.1 0.79 7 "Social Media Connection" 0.2 0.84 8 "Impress Us" 0.2 0.96 ==References== ==External links== * * * Rock Shrimp Productions The Full-Service Production Team Category:2010s American cooking television series Category:2019 American television series debuts Category:Cooking competitions in the United States Category:English-language television shows Category:Food Network original programming Category:Food reality television series Category:Television series by Rock Shrimp Productions Category:Television shows filmed in Texas Category:Television shows filmed in California
