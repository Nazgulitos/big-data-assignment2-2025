In biology, the BBCH-scale for leafy vegetables not forming heads describes the phenological development of leafy vegetables not forming heads, such as spinach, loosehead lettuce, and kale, using the BBCH-scale. The phenological growth stages and BBCH-identification keys of leafy vegetables not forming heads are: Growth stage Code Description 0: Germination 00 Dry seed 01 Beginning of seed imbibition 03 Seed imbibition complete 05 Radicle emerged from seed 07 Hypocotyl with cotyledons breaking through seed coat 09 Emergence: cotyledons break through soil surface 1: Leaf development (Main shoot) 10 Cotyledons completely unfolded; growing point or true leaf initial visible 11 First true leaf unfolded 12 2nd true leaf unfolded 13 3rd true leaf unfolded 1 . Stages continuous till ... 19 9 or more true leaves unfolded 3: Stem elongation of rosette growth 33 Leaf rosette has reached 30% of the expected diameter typical for the variety.1 Main shoot has reached 30% of the expected height typical for the variety² 35 Leaf rosette has reached 50% of the expected diameter typical for the variety.1 Main shoot has reached 50% of the expected height typical for the variety² 37 Leaf rosette has reached 70% of the expected diameter typical for the variety.1 Main shoot has reached 70% of the expected height for the variety² 39 Rosette development completed1 Main shoot has reached the height typical for the variety² 4: Development of harvestable vegetative plant parts 41 10% of the leaf mass typical for the variety reached 42 20% of the leaf mass typical for the variety reached 43 30% of the leaf mass typical for the variety reached 44 40% of the leaf mass typical for the variety reached 45 50% of the leaf mass typical for the variety reached 46 60% of the leaf mass typical for the variety reached 47 70% of the leaf mass typical for the variety reached 48 80% of the leaf mass typical for the variety reached 49 Typical leaf mass reached 5: Inflorescence emergence 51 Main shoot begins to elongate1 Main inflorescence visible between uppermost leaves² 53 30% of the expected height of the main shoot reached 55 First individual flowers of main inflorescence visible (still closed) 59 First flower petals visible; flowers still closed 6: Flowering 60 First flowers open (sporadically) 61 Beginning of flowering: 10% of flowers open 62 20% of flowers open 63 30% of flowers open 64 40% of flowers open 65 Full flowering: 50% of flowers open 67 Flowering finishing: majority of petals fallen or dry 69 End of flowering 7: Development of fruit 71 First fruits formed 72 20% of fruits have reached typical size 73 30% of fruits have reached typical size 74 40% of fruits have reached typical size 75 50% of fruits have reached typical size 76 60% of fruits have reached typical size 77 70% of fruits have reached typical size 78 80% of fruits have reached typical size 79 Fruits have reached typical size 8: Ripening of fruit and seed 81 Beginning of ripening: 10% of fruits ripe, or 10% of seeds of typical colour, dry and hard 82 20% of fruits ripe, or 20% of seeds of typical colour, dry and hard 83 30% of fruits ripe, or 20% of seeds of typical colour, dry and hard 84 40% of fruits ripe, or 20% of seeds of typical colour, dry and hard 85 50% of fruits ripe, or 50% of seeds of typical colour, dry and hard 86 60% of fruits ripe, or 20% of seeds of typical colour, dry and hard 87 70% of fruits ripe, or 20% of seeds of typical colour, dry and hard 88 80% of fruits ripe, or 20% of seeds of typical colour, dry and hard 89 Fully ripe: seeds on the whole plant of typical colour and hard 9: Senescence 92 Leaves and shoots beginning to discolor 95 50% of leaves yellow or dead 97 Plants dead 99 Harvested product (seeds) 1\.
