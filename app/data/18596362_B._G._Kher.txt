That area is known as Kherwadi in his memory. Kher established schools and a hospital, and provided electricity and water supply for people staying in Kherwadi. The Hindu-Khatik community celebrates his birthday at his statue at the Nanda Deep Garden, Kala Nagar, Bandra East. Declassified MI5 documents were appreciative of Kher and described him as preferable to other political candidates, due to his honesty, sincerity and a preference for the "Anglo" way of administration. ==References== ==Further reading== * Kamath, M.V.
