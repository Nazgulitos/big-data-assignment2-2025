The BBC Scotland Sports Personality of the Year (also known as Sportscene Personality of the Year until 1998) was an annual sport award in Scotland. It was organised by BBC Scotland. ==History== Between 1984 and 1996 it had its own show similar to the BBC Sports Personality of the Year with postal votes, a live audience and hosted by Dougie Donnelly, Archie Macpherson (until 1989), Hazel Irvine (from 1990) and Rob MacLean and for most years, it was often shown a week before the network version in December. The trophy was made by Caithness Glass with a diamond shape design. In 1997 and in 1998, it was decided by a public telephone vote with the winner being given the award on the usual Sportscene programme on Saturday nights. ==Winners== Year Name Sport Note 1977 Kenny Dalglish Footballer 1978 Kenny Dalglish Footballer 1979 colspan=3 1980 Allan Wells Athlete 1981–1983 colspan=3 1984 Robert Millar Cyclist 1985 Sandy Lyle Golfer 1986 Tom McKean Athlete 1987 Ally McCoist Footballer 1988 Liz McColgan Athlete 1989 Stephen Hendry Snooker player Stephen Hendry MBE BBC Sport, 21 January 2003 1990 David Sole Rugby player 1991 Liz McColgan Athlete 1992 Ally McCoist Footballer 1993 Graeme Obree Cyclist 1994 Yvonne Murray Athlete Scottish Sport Hall of Fame 2007 inductees Herald Scotland, 12 March 2007 1995 Gavin Hastings Rugby player 1996 Stephen Hendry Snooker player 1997 Walter Smith Football manager 1998 Henrik Larsson Footballer WONDER'S IN THE LARS CHANCE SALOON Daily Mirror, 9 May 1999 1999–2002 colspan=3 2003 Chris Hoy Cyclist 2004 Jim Anderson Swimmer Anderson wins the Scottish vote BBC Sport, 11 December 2004 2005 Andy Murray Tennis player Murray celebrates BBC Sport award BBC Sport, 9 December 2005BBC Scotland audiences serve ace result for Andrew Murray in Sports Personality poll BBC Press Office, 9 December 2005 2006 colspan=3 2007 Dario Franchitti Racing driver Key facts and figures - Edinburgh's famous people - culture and sport City of Edinburgh Council A 1986 team award went to badminton players Dan Travers and Billy Gilliland. ==See also== *Sport in Scotland *BBC Sports Personality of the Year ==References== ==External links== *BBC Scottish Sports Personality of the Year BBC Sport Scotland, December 2003 Scotland Category:BBC Scotland Category:Awards established in 1977 Category:1977 establishments in Scotland
