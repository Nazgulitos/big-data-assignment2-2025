Bernard Aloysius Wanniarachchi Jayamanne who was better known as B.A.W. Jayamanne (20 May 1908 – 16 February 1965: as බී.ඒ.ඩබ්ලිව්. ජයමාන්න) was a Sri Lankan playwright, director, producer and actor. He played a major role in the making of the first Sinhala film Kadawunu Poronduwa in 1947; Jayamanne achieved a level of popularity as a director with movies starring Rukmani Devi and Eddie Jayamanne in the 1950s. ==Personal life== Aloy was born on 2 May 1908 in Periyamulla, Negombo to W. Don Thomas, a teacher at Maris Stella College. He along with younger brother Eddie formed the Minerva theater group in the 1930s and achieved some fame running plays that depicted contemporary middle class and village situations in contrast to the Tower Hall plays popular at the time which featured archaic tales of Sri Lankan kings. The Minerva dramas usually featured Rukmani Devi, Eddie and Jemini Kantha in the lead roles. Aloy died on February 16, 1965, while making the film Magul Poruwa. It was completed by S. Ramanathan. ==Cinema career== Around 1947, Aloy was approached by South Indian producer S. M. Nayagam to turn his popular play Kadawunu Poronduwa into a movie. Nayagam had noted its popularity and concluded that it would be a fairly viable investment. Although having misgivings initially, Aloy relented and the film was produced and released to commercial success in April 1947. Aloy subsequently oversaw the adaption of a couple of his other plays before trying his hand at directing with Hadisi Vinischaya (with Mabel Blythe taking over for Jemini Kantha) in 1949. Due to the infancy of the film industry, BAW managed to dominate box office with minimal competition over the following years. Sangawunu Pilithura was released in 1951 and Umathu Wishwasaya in 1952. Aloy had one of his biggest hits with Kele Handa in 1953; it made Sri Lankan film history as the first direct literary adaption and introduced actress Rita Ratnayake. His subsequent films include Iranganie (1954), Mathabedaya (1955, introducing actress Ruby de Mel), Daiva Vipakaya (1956), Wanaliya (1958), Hadisi Vivahaya (1959), Kawata Andare (1960), Jeewithe Pujawe (1961), Mangalika (1963) and Magul Poruwa (1967). ==Filmography == ===As an actor=== Year Film Acting role Other roles 1947 Kadawunu Poronduwa Samson Screenwriter 1948 Kapati Arakshakaya Elder father Screenwriter 1948 Weradunu Kurumanama Screenwriter 1949 Hadisi Vinischaya Siripala Screenwriter 1950 Peralena Iranama Screenwriter 1951 Sengawunu Pilithura Kusumalata's father Screenwriter 1954 Iranganie Ariyadasa Screenwriter 1955 Mathabhedaya Ralahamy 1956 Daiva Vipakaya Wiloris Batugoda ===As a director=== Year Film Other roles 1950 Hadisi Vinischaya Producer 1951 Sengawunu Pilithura 1952 Umathu Vishwasaya 1953 Kele Handa Producer 1954 Iranganie Producer 1955 Mathabhedaya Producer 1956 Daiva Vipakaya Producer 1958 Wana Liya 1969 Hadisi Vivahaya 1960 Kawata Andare Producer 1961 Jeewitha Poojawa 1963 Mangalika 1967 Magul Poruwa ==References== == External links == * B.A.W.Jayamanne's Biography in Sinhala Cinema Database * Category:1965 deaths Category:Sri Lankan male film actors Category:Sinhalese male actors Category:1908 births Category:People from Negombo Category:20th-century Sri Lankan male actors
