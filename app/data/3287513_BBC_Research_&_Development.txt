BBC Research & Development is the technical research department of the BBC. ==Function== It has responsibility for researching and developing advanced and emerging media technologies for the benefit of the corporation, and wider UK and European media industries, and is also the technical design authority for a number of major technical infrastructure transformation projects for the UK broadcasting industry. ==Structure== BBC R&D; is part of the wider BBC Design & Engineering, and is led by Jatin Aythora, Director, Research & Development. In 2011, the North Lab moved into MediaCityUK in Salford along with several other departments of the BBC, whilst the South Lab remained in White City in London. ==History== In April 1930 the Development section of the BBC became the Research Department. The department as it stands today was formed in 1993 from the merger of the BBC Designs Department and the BBC Research Department. From 2006 to 2008 it was known as Research and Innovation but has since reverted to its original name. BBC Research & Development has made major contributions to broadcast technology, carrying out original research in many areas, and developing items like the peak programme meter (PPM) which became the basis for many world standards. ===Innovations=== It has also been involved in many well-known consumer technologies such as teletext, DAB, NICAM and Freeview. It was at the forefront of the development of FM radio, stereo FM, and RDS. These innovations have led to Queen's Awards for Innovation in 1969, 1974, 1983, 1987, 1992, 1998, 2001 and 2011. In the 1970s, its engineers designed the famous LS3/5A studio monitor for use in outside broadcasting units.Prakel, David (August 1979).

In early 2010 the Kingswood Warren site was vacated and the bulk of the department relocated to Centre House, in White City, London co-locating with the main campus of the BBC in London, whilst a significant number have moved to the new North Lab in MediaCityUK in Salford. BBC R&D; has more than 200 employees in their UK labs. ==Future projects== BBC R&D; engineers and researchers are currently active on approximately 50 projects, including 7 active national and international collaborative research efforts. These include R&D; projects built around BBC Reduxâ€”the proof of concept for the cross-platform, Flash video-based streaming version of the BBC iPlayer. ==See also== * A-weighting * Backstage.bbc.co.uk * CEEFAX * Dirac (codec) * Equal-loudness contour * ITU-R 468 noise weighting * * NICAM * Peak programme meter * Sound-in-Syncs * VERA videotape format ==References== ==External links== * * BBC R&D; Reports list 1933 - 1996 (PDF, 965 kB) * * Move * Location of South Lab ===Video clips=== * History of the department and interviews with the staff * Talk by Matthew Postgate in Manchester in November 2009 at TEDx Category:Audio engineering Category:Digital Video Broadcasting Category:Engineering research institutes Category:Freeview (UK) Category:Organisations based in Salford Category:Organisations based in Surrey Category:Radio technology Category:Reigate and Banstead Category:Research institutes in England Category:Science and technology in Greater Manchester Category:Scientific organizations established in 1923 Category:Sound production technology Category:Sound recording technology Category:Television technology Category:1923 establishments in the United Kingdom
