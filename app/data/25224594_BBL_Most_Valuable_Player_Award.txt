The British Basketball League Most Valuable Player award is an annual award of the United Kingdom's top professional basketball league, the British Basketball League. It is awarded to the league's top performing player throughout the duration of the season. The award is decided by a panel consisting of each of the League's team's head coaches, who submit one vote each at the end of the regular season, and the player with the most votes is presented with the award. Only on one occasion - the 2006–2007 season - has the award been shared between two players (Jeff Bonds and Brian Dux) due to a tie in the voting. Six players - Alton Byrd, Tony Dorsey, Trey Moore and Andrew Sullivan, Rahmon Fletcher, Justin Robinson - have won the award twice, whilst only three British-born players have won the award, namely Roger Huggins, Andrew Sullivan, and Justin Robinson. ==Winners== Season Player Team 2020–21 Geno Crandall Leicester Riders 2018–19 Justin Robinson (2x) London Lions 2017–18 Justin Robinson London Lions 2016–17 Rahmon Fletcher (2x) Newcastle Eagles 2015–16 Rahmon Fletcher Newcastle Eagles 2014–15 Charles Smith Newcastle Eagles 2013–14 Zaire Taylor Worcester Wolves 2012–13 Andrew Sullivan (2×) Leicester Riders 2011–12 Joe Chapman Newcastle Eagles 2010–11 Jeremy Bell Cheshire Jets 2009–10 Mike Cook Sheffield Sharks 2008–09 Trey Moore (2×) Newcastle Eagles 2007–08 Lynard Stewart Newcastle Eagles 2006–07 Jeff Bonds and Brian Dux Sheffield Sharks Guildford Heat 2005–06 Andrew Sullivan Newcastle Eagles 2004–05 Trey Moore Chester Jets 2003–04 Jerry Williams Scottish Rocks 2002–03 Kenny Gregory Chester Jets 2001–02 John Thomas Chester Jets 2000–01 Loren Meyer Chester Jets 1999–00 Tony Dorsey (2×) Manchester Giants 1998–99 Terrell Myers Sheffield Sharks 1997–98 Eric Burks Greater London Leopards 1996–97 John White Leopards 1995–96 Tony Dorsey Birmingham Bullets 1994–95 Roger Huggins Sheffield Sharks 1993–94 Nigel Lloyd Thames Valley Tigers 1992–93 Colin Irish Worthing Bears 1991–92 Alton Byrd (2×) Kingston Kings 1990–91 Alton Byrd Kingston Kings 1989–90 Clyde Vaughan Sunderland Saints 1988–89 Alan Cunningham Glasgow Rangers 1987–88 Daryl Thomas Hemel Royals ==References== ==External links== *BBl.org.uk *MikeShaft.com Category:British Basketball League Category:Basketball most valuable player awards Category:European basketball awards
