BBC London and South East was a pan-regional weekday lunchtime television news bulletin which was broadcast on BBC One in the London and South East regions between March and September 2020. The programme was produced and broadcast live from the BBC's South East Regional Production Centre in Royal Tunbridge Wells. All other local news bulletins remained separate for the two regions. The decision to merge the two programmes was due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom and to allow fewer studios to be needed for broadcasting. The lunchtime bulletin was first broadcast on 25 March 2020.Coronavirus Television News Coverage - TV Forum Combined breakfast bulletins had been broadcast during BBC Breakfast beforehand but these were dropped following the decision to temporarily remove local news bulletins during Breakfast due to the COVID-19 pandemic.BBC to stop showing regional news bulletins during Breakfast The final regular edition was broadcast on 4 September 2020.
