The album features guest appearances from TyFontaine, Trippie Redd, Lil Keed, Young Nudy, Iann Dior, Lil Skies, Lil Mosey, Cochise, TheHxliday, Lil Tecca, Swae Lee, Future, the Kid Laroi, late rapper and singer Juice Wrld, 24kGoldn, A Boogie wit da Hoodie, Wiz Khalifa, StaySolidRocky, LilSpirit, Kevin Gates, Gunna, Don Toliver, and Nav. ==Background== The album was first announced by Nick Mira and Taz Taylor in July 2020 during an interview with Lyrical Lemonade. Taylor stated: "We finalized our deal with 10K Projects in like August or September of last year [2019], but we had already been talking about an album for a minute. I brought it up to Elliot [Grainge] that I wanted to drop songs as an artist under Internet Moneyâ€”just my favorite artists working together and putting songs together, like some DJ Khaled type." Taylor said he gave himself a deadline of June 1, 2020 to turn the album in: "So we did the whole album in a month, top to bottom: features, big artists, beats, everything. We mixed and mastered the whole album at least 50 different times". The tracklist was revealed on August 14, 2020, along with the release of the single "Lemonade". According to Taylor, B4 the Storm contains many "throwaway" songs that artists did not want. With the blessing of the artists, many of the songs were changed into completely new records. ==Cover art== Alex Zidel of HotNewHipHop described the original album artwork, which "show[ed] an amusement park with American rapper and singer Trippie Redd's face opening up to allow people entry to the rides, much like American rapper and singer Travis Scott did for the cover of his third studio album, Astroworld. There [was] a special section for American rapper Lil Tecca and a blimp flying above for the late American rapper and singer Juice Wrld as each member of the Internet Money collective goes on a thrill-seeking rollercoaster ride". The artwork was designed by Moodzanzan. ==Commercial performance== The album debuted and peaked at number 10 on the Billboard 200 during the chart week of September 12, 2020. ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart performance for B4 the Storm Chart (2020) Peak position French Albums (SNEP) 88 Norwegian Albums (VG-lista) 4 ===Year-end charts=== 2020 year-end chart performance for B4 the Storm Chart (2020) Position US Billboard 200 184 US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard) 69 2021 year-end chart performance for B4 the Storm Chart (2021) Position US Billboard 200 166 US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard) 71 ==Certifications== ==References== Category:2020 albums Category:Hip hop albums by American artists
