While taking over, he emphasised that "The Army is a friend of every civilian and that message has been conveyed aptly by my predecessor. My every attempt would be to continue this practice". === Facilitate Return of Local Terrorist from Path of Terrorism === Lt Gen B S Raju's key focus is to allow those who have picked up arms to surrender and join the mainstream. It has greatly helped the youth who have gone "astray" to come back & with recruitment fairly lowest in last decade has resulted in substantial reduction in number of terrorist operating in Kashmir. With people as the centre of gravity, all his efforts are being directed in that direction during his command of prestigious XV Corps of Indian Army. Lt Gen B S Raju had underlined numerous times that the army is working more on ensuring surrender rather than going for straight neutralisation. === India, Pakistan Agree to Observe Ceasefire along LoC === On 25 February 2021 India Pakistan agreed to stand by the Ceasefire Agreement of 2003, which was a welcome move across both the borders.

In the last six months, seventeen of those who had strayed have come back and we will take care of them. My appeal to the youth who have gone astray is to come back. They can get back anytime, including during operations. They can call anybody, their parents, our helpline and we will organise their return," he said.

Hence 'day with company commander' came to give the feeling of a friendly next door neighbour and humsaya. This phenomenon became very popular across Kashmir and is being replicated at all the Company Operating Bases. Not only the boys but girls have also participated in these events in great numbers. === Chinar Corps Helpline === It was during Lt Gen B S Raju's tenure as a Corps Commander that Chinar Corps established a Feedback & Grievances Helpline (9484101010) for the population of Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. While inaugurating the helpline, Lt Gen B S Raju stressed that "Helpline number has been started to strengthen connectivity between people, Army in J-K."

More than 100 such events were conducted in which more than 6000 children participated. The hardy youth of the higher reaches showed great enthusiasm for such events. === Running of Army Goodwill School === The inclusion of digital learning in Army Goodwill Schools empowers the students by getting them to become more interested in learning and expanding their horizon. Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd in continuation to its CSR sponsorship for 'Digitization of the Army Goodwill Schools' has sponsored 10 more schools for digitization.
