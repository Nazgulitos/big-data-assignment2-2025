BBC Breakfast is the BBC television breakfast news programme. Produced by BBC News, the programme is broadcast on BBC One and the UK feed of BBC News channel. The simulcast is presented live, originally from the BBC Television Centre, London before moving in 2012 to MediaCityUK in Salford, Greater Manchester. The programme is broadcast daily and contains a mixture of news, sport, weather, business and feature items. ==Pre-BBC Breakfast history== Breakfast Time was the first BBC breakfast programme, with Ron Neil as producer. It was conceived in response to the plans of the commercial television company TV-am to introduce a breakfast television show. Breakfast Time's first broadcast was on 17 January 1983, and was presented by Frank Bough, Selina Scott and Nick Ross. The atmosphere of the set was intended to encourage a relaxed informality; the set mimicked a living-room rather than a studio, with red leather sofas, and Bough and Ross wearing jumpers and open- necked shirts. Ron Neil sought to make it part of the viewers' morning routine, with cookery, exercises, and (to some controversy) even an astrologer Russell Grant. Breakfast Time lasted 150 minutes, initially being transmitted between 6:30am and 9:00am, before moving to a 6:50am to 9:20am slot on 18 February 1985. Ron Neil See for example: Ian Jones, Morning Glory: A history of British breakfast television. Kelly, 2004; especially pp. 17–18, 22–29. departed from the programme and on 10 November 1986 a more conventional news focus was introduced featuring a news desk, presenters in suits and a shortened broadcast that began at 7:00am and ended any time between 8:30am and 8:55am. Presenters included Kirsty Wark, John Stapleton, Jeremy Paxman and Sally Magnusson. On 2 October 1989, the programme was renamed BBC Breakfast News and followed a more authoritative tone with a set modelled on the conventional desk style of news bulletins, starting at 6:30am. The programme had been planned to start in September but was postponed due to delays with the set. The first edition was presented by Nicholas Witchell and Jill Dando. The business news coverage extended to an hour-long programme in its own right called "Business Breakfast" in January 1993, beginning at 6:00am, while BBC Breakfast News started at 7:00am. In April 1993, both programmes moved to the then sixth floor N2 studio in a set used for the One, Six and Nine O'Clock News, using the new computer generated virtual set. Composer George Fenton reworked the theme tune for the Silicon Graphics CGI, title sequences were designed in-house by the BBC and the set was built by Television Production Design Ltd. A further revamp occurred in June 1997, when the programme was renamed simply Breakfast News. ==BBC Breakfast history== On 2 October 2000, the merging of separate breakfast programmes, BBC One and BBC News 24, into one single simulcast called Breakfast started, with the first show hosted by Sophie Raworth and Jeremy Bowen. The studio was replaced with a new set in 2003. Since 3 April 2006, the BBC News channel has returned to its traditional format (starting at 8:30am) while Breakfast continues on BBC One until 9:15am. In April 2008, BBC News 24 was renamed "BBC News", as part of a £550,000 rebranding of the BBC's news output, complete with a new studio and presentation. On 2 May 2006, Breakfast moved into studio N6 at Television Centre with other BBC One news programmes that required a larger set design that included walls of Barco video screens. The original screen scenes of cirrus clouds on a blue sky were changed as a result of viewer comments that 'it looked too cold'—their replacement was with orange squares of the same design as those appearing in the programme's new title sequence, which were designed to hide any joins or faults between the screens which had previously been obvious. The screens eventually displayed visuals needed for story content: different backgrounds, graphics and still photographs. More importantly, the set had a generic visual style that could be used for other programmes, such as the national news bulletins, without much additional physical change. The programme celebrated its 20th anniversary on 17 January 2003.20 years of breakfast television BBC News, 17 January 2003 On 28 January 2008, Breakfast returned to the TC7 studios, where Breakfast Time had been based following its move from the BBC Lime Grove Studios. On 2 March 2009, Breakfast relaunched with a new set and studio background. The backdrop resembled that of the BBC News channel as did the new Breakfast titles. In May 2009 as part of cost-cutting, the live broadcasts of the business news from the London Stock Exchange were dropped. In July 2010, the BBC announced that Breakfast was moving to their new studios in Salford Quays.BBC Breakfast moving to Salford BBC News, 14 July 2010 The BBC announced that with the April 2012 move to Salford, co-presenter Sian Williams and sports presenter Chris Hollins preferred not be included in the move to the North of England.Sian Williams opts out of BBC Breakfast move BBC News, 31 March 2011 Williams left Breakfast on 15 March 2012. On 12 December 2011, the first of several presenter changes was announced. Louise Minchin would, with the studio move to Salford, join the other main presenters of BBC Breakfast: Bill Turnbull, Susanna Reid and Charlie Stayt. Carol Kirkwood, on 26 March 2012, would remain in London presenting weather. Sports presenters Mike Bushell and Sally Nugent and business presenter Steph McGovern would locate to Salford. The first Breakfast edition from Salford occurred on Tuesday 10 April 2012. London-based newspapers have reported extensive criticism of the BBC move, but a decrease in audience did not occur, with the retention of an approximate average of 1.5 million viewers. The 2012 Summer Olympics prompted BBC Breakfast to temporarily broadcast from a temporary studio near the Olympic Park in Stratford. During the Games, former presenters Sian Williams and Chris Hollins also returned to lead the morning programme, in addition to Bill Turnbull, Charlie Stayt, Louise Minchin, and BBC Sport presenter Hazel Irvine. The show ended its temporary London return with broadcasting from the BBC News channel's studio on the morning following the closing ceremonies before rebroadcasting from Salford the next day. On 19 March 2013, BBC Breakfast updated its "lower thirds" to match the graphics and fonts used by the rest of BBC News since the previous day. The clock was consequently moved to the lower right side of the screen. In 2014, Susanna Reid left the programme to join a revamped Good Morning Britain on ITV. Naga Munchetty became a regular presenter, hosting with Charlie Stayt from Thursday- Saturday every week, after a number of years as a relief presenter, including regularly presenting Sunday's programme. On 23 July 2014, the show went on location again, this time to Glasgow to showcase highlights from the 2014 Commonwealth Games. In the hours leading up to the opening ceremony, Carol Kirkwood reported from Celtic Park. The day after the end of the Games, Charlie Stayt presented from Glasgow Cathedral in the lead up to ceremonies marking 100 years since the start of World War I. In February 2016, Bill Turnbull left the programme and was replaced by Dan Walker. For the 2016 Summer Olympics, the programme was again renamed Olympic Breakfast and was anchored by Salford and Rio broadcasting from the BBC Sport studio. In September 2019, Naga Munchetty was initially ruled to have breached the BBC's guidelines by criticising US President Donald Trump for perceived racism. That July, while presenting BBC Breakfast, Munchetty had taken issue with Trump's comments telling his opponents to "go back" to the "places from which they came". Munchetty said: "Every time I have been told, as a woman of colour, to go back to where I came from, that was embedded in racism. Now I'm not accusing anyone of anything here, but you know what certain phrases mean." Several public figures, including Lenny Henry and Adrian Lester, signed an open letter asking the corporation to revisit its ruling against her. It was later reported in The Guardian that the complaint was also made against her co-host Dan Walker, but his comments were not the focus of the BBC's executive complaints unit (ECU) investigation, due to the complainant's follow up complaint focusing solely on Munchetty. Later that day, the Director-General of the BBC Tony Hall overturned the decision after looking into it personally. In June 2021, Louise Minchin announced she would be leaving BBC Breakfast, 20 years after she joined the programme. Her final show was on 15 September 2021. From 20 September, Sally Nugent co-hosted alongside Dan Walker. On 27 October 2021, Sally Nugent announced that she would permanently join the programme as the new Monday-Wednesday presenter. It was announced on 4 April 2022 that Dan Walker would be leaving Breakfast to join ITN to be a joint lead presenter for Channel 5 News. His final show was on 17 May 2022. On 26 May 2022, the BBC announced that Breakfast, along with the BBC News at Six and Ten will be revamped in June 2022 to include a completely new studio and presentation, as part of a wider rebrand of the BBC. Local regional programmes will also be revamped over the coming months to tie in with the regional BBC channels broadcasting in HD by the beginning of 2023. It was announced on 8 July that Jon Kay would permanently replace Dan Walker after being a stand-in presenter for Breakfast. After the unification of BBC News for UK viewers and international viewers in April 2023, the programme continues to be simulcast only on the UK feed, while the international feed shows generic bulletin and World Business Report. On 26 June 2023, BBC Breakfast unveiled a new look for the programme, moving to an all-new multipurpose studio in Media City in Salford ==Format== Between 6:00am and 09:00am on weekdays, the programme is simulcast on BBC News. During the simulcast, the sports news is at 6:10am, 6:35am, 7:35am and 8:35. In addition, live sports bulletins are broadcast from sporting locations, such as Royal Ascot and Wimbledon, with the presenter interviewing key sporting figures. Business updates are presented at 6:10am, when the main business stories from the newspapers are also discussed, and then at 20minutes and 50minutes past the hour, either from the studio, or out on location. The United Kingdom weather forecast is at 10minutes and 40minutes past the hour throughout the programme, either from the BBC Weather Centre in Broadcasting House, or out on location. Short (approximately four minutes) regional news, travel and weather bulletins broadcast just before the hour and the half-hour throughout the programme. Once the BBC News Channel breaks away for its own programming (starting from Nicky Campbell on BBC Radio 5 Live) at 9:00am, the programme is extended until 9:15am on BBC One. The programme is shortened to three hours on bank holidays but still features regional news updates, and is fully simulcast on the UK feed of BBC News Channel. During weekends, there are no updates from regional news bureaus. The first and/or second hour of the weekend edition may occasionally feature abridged versions of the BBC's other programmes such as Click, Reporters (shown in full at 6:30am on Sundays), Newswatch (shown on Saturdays at 7:45am), The Travel Show and the Film Review. They also have a paper review with guests, and Paul Lewis normally discusses business or personal finance news. The show is also simulcast on BBC One and the BBC News Channel, but, during the Premier League season, BBC One regularly breaks away on Sundays to show the previous night's edition of Match of the Day. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the presenters moved to sit apart on the sofa. Sports presenters are traditionally seated towards the end of the sofa, whereas business items are usually given from a standing or seated position located some distance from the main presenters. ==Interactive== Breakfast encourages viewer response and interaction via e-mail, Facebook and Twitter.Contact us BBC News, 29 June 2010Contact us BBC News, 28 May 2010 Video reports and interviews from the programme are made available on the Breakfast Facebook page after transmission. == Current on-air team == Main presenters Note: Sunday editions of BBC Breakfast are presented by two of the regular stand-in presenting team Tenure Person Days Presenting 2022– Jon Kay Monday-Wednesday 2021– Sally Nugent 2008– Charlie Stayt Thursday-Saturday 2014– Naga Munchetty === Stand-in presenters === Tenure Person 2012– Roger Johnson 2015– Rachel Burden Victoria Valentine Ben Thompson 2016– Tina Daheley 2019– Nina Warhurst 2020– Sima Kotecha 2021– Luxmy Gopal 2022– Ben Boulos 2023– Sarah Campbell === Business presenters === Person Position Days Nina Warhurst Main Presenter Monday-Wednesday Hannah Miller Thursday-Friday Ben Boulos Relief presenter Stand-in days === Sports presenters === Person Position Days Presenting John Watson Main Presenter Monday-Wednesday Mike BushellMike Bushell Profile, BBC Breakfast website.
