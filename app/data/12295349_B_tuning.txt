thumb|right|Baritone tuning B Tuning or B Standard Tuning is the standard tuning for a seven string guitar, where the strings are tuned B-E-A-D-G-B-E. B tuning can also be achieved on a six-string guitar, when the strings are tuned B-E-A-D-F♯-B, known then as Baritone Tuning. This tuning is popular among several different types of metal bands. Some bands use a tuning known as "drop A tuning", where they drop the low B to A, so the tuning for a 7-string guitar is as follows A1-E2-A2-D3-G3-B3-E4. Also, for a 6-string guitar, drop A tuning is achieved by tuning all strings down a 4th with the lowest string tuned 1 additional step down as follows A1-E2-A2-D3-F#3-B3. This is a "drop 1" tuning in the key of B (i.e. tune the whole guitar down a perfect fourth from standard tuning, then tune the 6th string a whole step down). ==Used by== * A Day to Remember (some songs) * Aborted * The Absence * Aeon (7-string guitars) * Aghora (7-string guitars) (on the album Aghora (album)) * Allegaeon (7-string guitars) * All Shall Perish * Alterbeast * Alter Bridge (some songs) * Amaranthe (since Massive Addictive) * Amenra * Amon Amarth (on most albums) * Amputated * Anacrusis * Anal Cunt * ANTISMA * Anathema * Angel Vivaldi (7-string guitars) * Animals as Leaders (On most of their first album, 7-string guitars) * * Arch Enemy (On their first three albums: Black Earth, Stigmata and Burning Bridges; and a few songs from their more recent albums) * Arctic Monkeys (If You Were There, Beware; Alex Turner uses a baritone guitar) * Arcturus * Armagedda * Asking Alexandria (some songs) * At the Gates * Attack Attack!
