B-Sides Collect is a compilation album by Canadian electro-industrial band Skinny Puppy, released in 1999. The album serves as a collection of several B-sides from earlier singles that were out of print by the time of the collection's release. With the exception of "Serpents", this release complements one of the band's earlier compilations, Twelve Inch Anthology. Not all Skinny Puppy B-sides are represented on this release due to time and label restrictions. Other B-sides that had previously been available but do not appear on this release include: "Censor (Extended Mix)", "Tin Omen (Reload)", "Spasmolytic (Remix)", "Walking On Ice (Live)", "Inquisition (Extended Mix)", and "Choralone (Live)". == Track listing == == Personnel == ;Skinny Puppy * Nivek Ogre – vocals * cEvin Key – synthesizers, guitars, bass guitars, drums * Dwayne Goettel – synthesizers, sampling ;Additional personnel * Dale Plevin – fretless bass on tracks 9, 16 * Alien Jourgensen – additional guitar on 11, production on 13 * Ken Marshall – mixing on 7, 9, 14, 15 * Adrian Sherwood – production on 1 * Dave Ogilvie – mixing on 9, production on 13 * Greg Reely – mixing on 9 * Marc Ramaer – mixing on 11, 12 == References == Category:B-side compilation albums Category:1999 compilation albums Category:Skinny Puppy compilation albums Category:Nettwerk Records compilation albums
