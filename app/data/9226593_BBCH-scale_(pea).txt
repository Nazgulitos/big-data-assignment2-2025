In biology, the BBCH-scale for peas describes the phenological development of peas using the BBCH-scale. The phenological growth stages and BBCH- identification keys of peas are: Growth stage Code Description 0: Germination 00 Dry seed 01 Beginning of seed imbibition 03 Seed imbibition complete 05 Radicle emerged from seed 07 Shoot breaking through seed coat 08 Shoot growing towards soil surface; hypocotyl arch visible 09 Emergence: shoot breaks through soil surface (“cracking stage”) 1: Leaf development 10 Pair of scale leaves visible 11 First true leaf (with stipules) unfolded or first tendril developed 12 2 leaves (with stipules) unfolded or 2 tendrils developed 13 3 leaves (with stipules) unfolded or 3 tendrils developed 1 . Stages continuous till ... 19 9 or more leaves (with stipules) unfolded or 9 or more tendrils developed 3: Stem elongation (Main shoot) 30 Beginning of stem elongation 31 1 visibly extended internode1 32 2 visibly extended internodes1 33 3 visibly extended internodes1 3 . Stages continuous till ... 39 9 or more visibly extended internodes1 5: Inflorescence emergence 51 First flower buds visible outside leaves 55 First separated flower buds visible outside leaves but still closed 59 First petals visible, flowers still closed 6: Flowering 60 First flowers open (sporadically within the population) 61 Beginning of flowering: 10% of flowers open 62 20% of flowers open 63 30% of flowers open 64 40% of flowers open 65 Full flowering: 50% of flowers open 67 Flowering declining 69 End of flowering 7: Development of fruit 71 10% of pods have reached typical length; juice exudes if pressed 72 20% of pods have reached typical length; juice exudes if pressed 73 30% of pods have reached typical length; juice exudes if pressed.Tenderometer value: 80 TE 74 40% of pods have reached typical length; juice exudes if pressed.Tenderometer value: 95 TE 75 50% of pods have reached typical length; juice exudes if pressed.Tenderometer value: 105 TE 76 60% of pods have reached typical length; juice exudes if pressed.Tenderometer value: 115 TE 77 70% of pods have reached typical length. Tenderometer value: 130 TE 79 Pods have reached typical size (green ripe); peas fully formed 8: Ripening of fruit and seed 81 10% of pods ripe, seeds final colour, dry and hard 82 20% of pods ripe, seeds final colour, dry and hard 83 30% of pods ripe, seeds final colour, dry and hard 84 40% of pods ripe, seeds final colour, dry and hard 85 50% of pods ripe, seeds final colour, dry and hard 86 60% of pods ripe, seeds final colour, dry and hard 87 70% of pods ripe, seeds final colour, dry and hard 88 80% of pods ripe, seeds final colour, dry and hard 89 Fully ripe: all pods dry and brown. Seeds dry and hard (dry ripe) 9: Senescence 97 Plants dead and dry 99 Harvested product 1 The first internode extends from the scale leaf node to the first true leaf node ==References== * * Category:BBCH-scale
