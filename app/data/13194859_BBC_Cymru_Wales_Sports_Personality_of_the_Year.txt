The BBC Cymru Wales Sports Personality of the Year is a televised sporting competition, broadcast on BBC Two every year; and the most prestigious annual sport award in Wales. It was first awarded in 1954, and is currently organised by BBC Cymru Wales. Since a trial in 2002, the competition has been open to public voting, rather than a decision being made within the competition prior to this. More recently it has reverted to being chosen by an expert panel of judges. == Winners == Year Name Field 2022 Para-athletics 2021 Boxing 2019 Rugby union 2018 Cycling 2017 Rugby union 2016 Taekwondo 2015 Rugby union 2014 Cycling 2013 Rugby union 2012 Taekwondo 2011 Motorcycle racing 2010 Football 2009 Football 2008 Rugby union 2007 Boxing 2006 Joe Calzaghe Boxing 2005 Rugby union 2004 Wheelchair racing 2003 Road bicycle racing 2002 Football 2001 Joe Calzaghe Boxing 2000 Tanni Grey-Thompson Wheelchair racing 1999 Athletics (110-metre hurdles) 1998 Athletics (400 metres) 1997 Rugby union 1996 Football 1995 Football 1994 Boxing 1993 Colin Jackson Athletics (110-metre hurdles) 1992 Tanni Grey-Thompson Wheelchair racing 1991 Golf 1990 Ian Woosnam Golf 1989 Golf 1988 Colin Jackson Athletics (110-metre hurdles) 1987 Ian Woosnam Golf 1986 Athletics (middle distances) 1985 Marathon 1984 Football 1983 Boxing 1982 Race walker 1981 Football 1980 Golf 1979 Snooker 1978 Boxing 1977 Rugby union 1976 and the Wales national rugby union team Rugby union 1975 Football 1974 Rugby union 1973 Athletics (100 metres hurdles) 1972 Eventing 1971 , the Wales national rugby union team and the British Lions Rugby union 1970 Show jumping 1969 Cricket 1968 Swimming 1967 Boxing 1966 Athletics (long jump) 1965 Rugby union 1964 Lynn Davies Athletics (long jump) 1963 Howard Winstone Boxing 1962 Football 1961 Rugby union 1960 Boxing 1959 Football 1958 Howard Winstone Boxing 1957 Golf 1956 Boxing 1955 Athletics (3000 metre steeplechase) 1954 Rugby union, Athletics (sprinting) No award was made in 2020 due to the effects on sport of the Covid-19 pandemic. == See also == *Sport in Wales *BBC Sports Personality of the Year ==References== ;General ;Specific ==External links== *List of all winners from 1954â€“2006 Wales Category:BBC Cymru Wales Category:Awards established in 1954 Category:1954 establishments in Wales
