The first five-minute bulletins, Today in Northern Ireland, were presented by Maurice Shillington and broadcast from a tiny radio studio within Broadcasting House in Belfast. Up until the launch of Today in Northern Ireland, a networked topical magazine programme, Ulster Mirror, had been broadcast every fortnight since Friday 26 November 1954. The new daily bulletins were later expanded to ten minutes and supplemented by a magazine programme called Studio Eight, first broadcast on Friday 20 February 1959 with Robert Coulter as its presenter. Today in Northern Ireland was replaced on 17 September 1962 by a 20-minute programme initially known as Six O'Clock.Your Place & Mine – Scene Around Six, bbc.co.uk The new longer magazine programmes changed title to Six Five and Six Ten until Scene Around Six was introduced in January 1968. Main presenters during the programme's history included Larry McCoubrey, Barry Cowan and Sean Rafferty. The launch of the national Six O'Clock News led to Scene Around Six being relaunched as Inside Ulster in September 1984. On Tuesday 7 May 1985, the programme was moved to an earlier timeslot of 5.35pm. Newsline 6:30 was introduced on 12 February 1996 when the main evening programme returned to a 6.30pm timeslot.
