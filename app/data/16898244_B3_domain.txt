The B3 DNA binding domain (DBD) is a highly conserved domain found exclusively in transcription factors (â‰¥40 species) () combined with other domains (). It consists of 100-120 residues, includes seven beta strands and two alpha helices that form a DNA-binding pseudobarrel protein fold (); it interacts with the major groove of DNA. == B3 families == In Arabidopsis thaliana, there are three main families of transcription factors that contain B3 domain: * ARF (Auxin Response Factors) * ABI3 (ABscisic acid Insensitive3) * RAV (Related to ABI3/VP1) protein ARF1-B3 ABI3-B3 RAV1-B3 B3 structure derived by molecular model molecular model NMR B3 recognition sequence TGTCTC CATGCA CACCTG and are only known NMR solution phase structures of the B3 DNA Binding Domain. == Related proteins == The N-terminal domain of restriction endonuclease EcoRII; the C-terminal domain of restriction endonuclease BfiI possess a similar DNA- binding pseudobarrel protein fold. == See also == *Restriction endonuclease EcoRII *Auxin *Abscisic acid == References == ==External links== * DBD database of predicted transcription factors Uses a curated set of DNA-binding domains to predict transcription factors in all completely sequenced genomes *Classification in the "Transcription factors" table according to the Transfac database. *Database of Arabidopsis Transcription Factors *B3 , RAV, and ARF family at PlantTFDB:Plant Transcription Factor Database Category:Molecular genetics Category:Gene expression Category:Transcription factors Category:Protein domains
