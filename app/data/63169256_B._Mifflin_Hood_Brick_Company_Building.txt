The B. Mifflin Hood Brick Company Building is a historic building in Atlanta, Georgia. Located in the Virginiaâ€“Highland neighborhood, the building was built in 1909 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. == History == The building was constructed in 1909 to serve as a showroom and headquarters for the B. Mifflin Hood Brick Company. B. Mifflin Hood, a businessman who had moved to Atlanta from Philadelphia, founded the company in 1904 and distinguished his company from his competitors by marketing his products as "non-convict brick", as Hood did not participate in the convict leasing system that was prevalent in Georgia at this time. Hood also helped to improve the brick-making industry in the Southern United States by introducing new technological advancements and by founding a Ceramic Engineering Department at the Georgia School of Technology. In 1921, the building underwent a massive renovation project that tripled the area of the building. B. Mifflin Hood Brick Company continued to operate in the building until 1947. On December 6, 2018, the one-story, 11-bay building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The building is located along the BeltLine. == See also == * National Register of Historic Places listings in Fulton County, Georgia == References == == External links == * Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:National Register of Historic Places in Atlanta Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1909 Category:Virginia-Highland
