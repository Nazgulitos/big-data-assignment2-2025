It's evident that they're talented and sound good together, but it'll take another album or two before they're able to prove themselves as more than just another boy group. This album should have no problem winning them a preteen fan base, and the parents of those fans will be thankful for the lack of a parental advisory sticker." == Track listing == # "Let It Be" (The Beatles cover) – 0:57 # "U Got Me" – 3:27 # "Dance for You" – 3:57 # "So Pretty" – 3:36 # "All I Do" (Jackson 5 cover) – 3:45 # "Teacher's Pet" – 4:23 # "Let Me Know" – 3:33 # "Nothin 'Bout Me" – 3:18 # "Heartbreak" – 3:09 # "Back in Your Arms" – 3:13 # "No More Games" – 3:09 # "You Don't Know" – 3:47 Sample credits "Back in Your Arms" contains samples from Michael Jackson's "I Wanna Be Where You Are" ==Charts== Chart (2005) Peak position ==References== Category:2005 debut albums Category:B5 (group) albums Category:Bad Boy Records albums Category:Albums produced by Rodney Jerkins Category:Albums produced by Sean Garrett
