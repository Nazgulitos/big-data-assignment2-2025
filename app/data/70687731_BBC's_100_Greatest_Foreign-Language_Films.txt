BBC's 100 Greatest Foreign Language Films is a list compiled in 2018 by BBC Culture, as part of their annual critics' poll. == Selection Criteria == BBC Culture polled 209 film critics from 43 different countries, asking them to submit their list of the 10 greatest foreign-language movies (i.e. not in English). As with other BBC Culture 100 Greatest polls, the ranking was established by a point system: ten points awarded to the film ranked first, nine to the film ranked second and so forth. == Criticism == Writing for Vanity Fair, K. Austin Collins lamented the predictability of the list - "heavy on works from Europe and East Asia; low on women; low on avant garde and documentary filmmaking" - and the absence of popular genres such as Nollywood, Bollywood or Giallo, arguing that "a truly worthy list of this nature wouldn’t be so snobby about high and low culture. It’d be a glorious, messy mix of arthouse and pop, as any list about the greatest art—rather than the greatest textbook art—should be." == Partial list == No. Title Director Country Original Language Year 1 Seven Samurai Akira Kurosawa Japan Japanese 1954 2 Bicycle Thieves Vittorio De Sica Italy Italian 1948 3 Tokyo Story Yasujirō Ozu Japan Japanese 1953 4 Rashomon Akira Kurosawa Japan Japanese 1950 5 The Rules of the Game Jean Renoir France French 1939 6 Persona Ingmar Bergman Sweden Swedish 1966 7 8½ Federico Fellini Italy, France Italian 1963 8 The 400 Blows François Truffaut France French 1959 9 In the Mood for Love Wong Kar-wai Hong Kong, France Cantonese 2000 10 La Dolce Vita Federico Fellini Italy, France Italian, English, French, German 1960 == References == Category:BBC-related lists Category:Top film lists Category:Film criticism Category:2018 in film
