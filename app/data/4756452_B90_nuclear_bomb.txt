thumb|B90 Depth Strike Bomb. The B90 Nuclear Depth Strike Bomb (NDSB) was an American thermonuclear bomb designed at Lawrence Livermore National Labs in the mid-to-late 1980s and cancelled prior to introduction into military service due to the end of the Cold War. The B90 design was intended for use as a naval aircraft weapon, for use as a nuclear depth bomb and as a land attack strike bomb. It was intended to replace the B57 nuclear bomb used by the Navy. The B90 bomb design entered Phase 3 development engineering and was assigned its numerical designation in June 1988. The B90 was in diameter and long, and weighed . The B90's yield has been described at both and "low kt". This may indicate a variable yield weapon. The B90 was cancelled in September 1991 along with the W89 and W91 nuclear warheads and AGM-131 SRAM II and SRAM-T missile models. No B90 production models were built, though test units may have been; US nuclear weapon testing continued until 1992. ==See also== * List of nuclear weapons ==References== ==External links== * University of California 1989 nuclear weapons labs status report * Allbombs.html at the Nuclear Weapon Archive at nuclearweaponarchive.org Category:Nuclear bombs of the United States Category:Cold War aerial bombs of the United States Category:Depth charges
