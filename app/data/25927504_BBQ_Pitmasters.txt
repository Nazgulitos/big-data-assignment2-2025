BBQ Pitmasters is an American reality television series which follows barbecue cooks as they compete for cash and prizes in barbecue cooking competitions. The series premiered on TLC on December 3, 2009. The eight-episode first season was filmed in a docu-reality format, as it followed several competing BBQ teams around the country to various BBQ contests. Season two premiered on August 12, 2010, at 10 pm EDT featuring a completely new competition game show-based format. Each week, four teams competed against each other. Challenges included common protein and more exotic meat. Weekly winners faced off against each other in the second-season finale as they vied for $100,000 and the Kingsford Cup. The judges for the second season were Myron Mixon, Art Smith, and Warren Sapp. Kevin Roberts served as host. On January 29, 2012, Myron Mixon confirmed on his Facebook account for Jack's Old South that filming for Season 3 would start in March. On April 4, 2012, it was announced that Season 3 would air on Destination America, which is a rebranded version of the Planet Green channel that launched on May 26, 2012. On May 26, 2014, Destination America debuted a preview of their new TV series named BBQ Pit Wars. The episode first aired on May 31, 2014. This new reality show uses the old docu-reality format of BBQ Pitmasters season 1 (many viewers had voiced their preference for this format on the channel's website), in which Myron Mixon is one of the team competitors rather than a BBQ judge. Along with Stump McDowell of Stump's BBQ, Moe Cason of Ponderosa BBQ, and Michael Character of Character BBQ, the four teams compete in regional BBQ championships around the nation, for prizes, and bragging rights to be named the master of BBQ. ==Series overview== Season Episodes Season Premiere Season Finale 1 8 2 6 3 6 4 7 5 13 6 9 7 9 ==Season 1== ===Season 1: Teams=== * Jack's Old South, led by Myron Mixon * Smokin' Triggers BBQ, led by Johnny Trigg * Slap Yo' Daddy BBQ, led by Harry Soo * Cool Smoke, led by Tuffy Stone * Wood Chick's BBQ, owned by Lee Ann Whippen * Jambo Pits, led by Jamie Geer * Pablo Diablo's, led by Paul Petersen, a recognized Texas chef but BBQ rookie. * Notley Que BBQ led by Gary Notley ==Season 2== ===Season 2: Judges=== * Myron Mixon—season one competitor and owner of Jack's Old South * Art Smith—celebrity chef and author of Back to the Table and Kitchen Life * Warren Sapp—Super Bowl champion and barbecue enthusiast ===Contestants=== ====Season 2: Preliminary Results (Ep. 1-5)==== Episode Pitmaster Team Hometown Episode Result 1 Moe Cason Ponderosa BBQ Des Moines, Iowa Ryan Amys Hot Grill on Grill Action Omaha, Nebraska Nicole Davenport Taint the Sauce Sheffield, Texas Harrison Sapp Southern Soul BBQ Saint Simons Island, Georgia 2 Melissa Cookston Yazoo's Delta Q Nesbit, Mississippi John Fernandez-Melone Bare Bones BBQ Pleasanton, California Rhoda Brown Smokin' Fatties West Monroe, Louisiana Brent Walton QN4U Clovis, California 3 Craig Kimmel Firehouse BBQ DeLand, Florida Bubba Latimer Bub-Ba-Q Jasper, Georgia Joe Davidson Joe BBQ Bixby, Oklahoma Kyle Laval/Stephanie Wilson The Slabs Kansas City, Missouri 4 Johnny Trigg Smokin' Triggers Alvarado, Texas Danielle Dimovski Diva Q Barrie, Ontario Jody Clark Big Poppa Smokers Coachella, California Neil Strawder Bigmistas Long Beach, California 5 Shad Kirton A Boy & His BBQ Grimes, Iowa Dan Hixon 3 Eyz BBQ Owings Mills, Maryland Lee Ann Whippen Wood Chicks BBQ Chesapeake, Virginia Tyler Sayler Big Mouth Smokers Memphis, Tennessee ====Season 2: Final Results (Ep. 6)==== Episode Pitmaster Team Hometown Episode Result 6 Shad Kirton A Boy & His BBQ Grimes, Iowa Melissa Cookston Yazoo's Delta Q Nesbit, Mississippi Johnny Trigg Smokin' Triggers Alvarado, Texas Moe Cason Ponderosa BBQ Des Moines, Iowa Eliminated Craig Kimmel Firehouse BBQ DeLand, Florida ==Season 3== In this season, three teams compete in each episode.
