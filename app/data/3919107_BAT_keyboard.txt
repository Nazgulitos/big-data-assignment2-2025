A BAT keyboard is a one-handed chording keyboard consisting of a base, on which the hand rests, and seven keys. Through pressing combinations of keys, one can attain the same functions as a regular keyboard. The keyboard can be useful for those with a disability and also as a complement to the mouse, on which the other hand can remain. The BAT keyboard exists in left-handed and right-handed versions, which can also be used simultaneously with each other or even with another alphanumeric keyboard if desired. ==See also== *Chorded keyboard == External links == *BAT keyboard â€” One-handed desktop chording keyboard *Manual shows chord layout Category:Computer keyboard types Category:Physical ergonomics
