Bardet–Biedl syndrome 10, also known as BBS10 is a human gene. == Function == The Bardet-Biedl syndrome 10 protein has distant sequence homology to type II chaperonins. As a molecular chaperone, this protein may affect the folding or stability of other ciliary or basal body proteins. Inhibition of this protein's expression impairs ciliogenesis in preadipocytes. == Clinical significance == Mutations in this gene are associated with the Bardet–Biedl syndrome. == References == ==Further reading== * * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== * GeneReviews/NIH/NCBI/UW entry on Bardet-Biedl Syndrome * *
