BBC Knowledge was a television channel available in various countries outside the United Kingdom, showcasing factual and non-fiction entertainment programming from the BBC and independent UK production houses. Wholly owned by BBC Studios, it is not related to the previous channel known as BBC Knowledge, an early digital channel available within the UK, which closed down in 2002 in favour of BBC Four and CBeebies. At one time, the channel provided five key programming strands enabling simple appointment viewing: * The World delved and explored new cultures around the world * Science & Technology explored new frontiers, from space to motoring * People explored aspects of the human body and mind * The Past brought historical events, places and people back to life * Business offered invaluable advice to help stay on top of today's challenging business world. On 15 November 2009, BBC Knowledge in Australia changed their channel location from Channel 619 to Channel 612. In 2014 it was announced that BBC Studios would rollout a new channel, BBC Earth, which would replace BBC Knowledge in most locations, except for where it was successful. Poland was the first location to launch the new brand on 1 February 2015. ==Launch and closure dates== BBC Knowledge was first launched in Singapore on mio TV (Now in Singtel TV) in July 2007. It has been available on now TV in Hong Kong since October 2007 and on the Cyfrowy Polsat digital satellite platform in Poland from December 2007 (Cyfra Plus in Poland plans its launch only on 1 Feb 2011 due to prior exclusive BBC deals with Polsat).

In June 2009, citing the lack of viewership, the BBC terminated its carriage deal with SingTel's mio TV to air BBC Knowledge, (along with CBeebies and BBC Lifestyle), and entered into an agreement with StarHub TV to carry the channels from 1 August 2009, and in Romania on 31 December 2010. BBC Knowledge was launched on Cable TV Hong Kong on 29 October 2009.
