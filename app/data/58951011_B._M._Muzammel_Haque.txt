B. M. Muzammel Haque () is a Bangladesh Awami League politician who has been an organising secretary of the party's Central Working Committee since 2009, and was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Shariatpur-1 from 2008 through 2018. ==Early life== Haque was born on 1 July 1957. He completed a master's degree. ==Career== In 2008, Haque was selected to be the Awami League candidate for the parliamentary seat of Shariatpur-1. He was elected at the 2008 general election, gaining 64% of the vote, and retained the seat in 2014. At the Awami League's triennial council session in 2009, he was named as an organising secretary of the party's Central Working Committee, and continued in the post after the 2012, 2016, and 2019 councils. In April 2014, he was investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) for allegedly misappropriating government funds. He expressed confidence that the ACC would find the allegations baseless. Haque sought renomination by the Awami League to contest the 2018 general election, but was unsuccessful. He faced opposition from what the Dhaka Tribune characterized as "a significantly large" number of local party leaders. Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader explained Haque not being nominated by saying that the Prime Minister had other important election duties for him to perform. ==References== Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:People from Shariatpur District Category:Awami League politicians Category:9th Jatiya Sangsad members Category:10th Jatiya Sangsad members
