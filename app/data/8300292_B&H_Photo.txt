In November 2009, a lawsuit against B&H; Photo alleged that the store refused to hire women, in violation of New York City and New York State Human Rights Laws. The lawsuit, brought by four women, sought class action status on behalf of all women discriminated against by B&H; over the course of many years. Given B&H;'s prior alleged discriminatory practices, the lawsuit sought US$19 million in compensatory and punitive damages to deter future discriminatory practices. In 2011, a lawsuit alleged discrimination against Hispanic workers. In February 2016, the United States Department of Labor Office of Contract Compliance filed a lawsuit against B&H; alleging that the company had hired Hispanic men only into entry-level jobs in a Brooklyn warehouse, and then subjected them to harassment and unsanitary conditions. On August 16, 2017, the company announced that it had settled this matter for a reported $3.22 million, while not admitting any wrongdoing. In November 2019, according to The Verge, the Attorney General of New York State filed a lawsuit alleging that B&H; knowingly failed to pay millions of dollars in sales taxes due in New York. The company's spokesperson has said that "B&H; has done nothing wrong and it is outrageous". According to B&H;, the Attorney General is alleging that customers should pay sales tax on pre-discounted prices, not on the actual selling price, which is the widespread industry practice. In September 2021, the NY Supreme Court ruled in B&H;’s favor and dismissed the Attorney General’s suit agreeing with B&H;’s position in the matter. ==Recognition== In May 2007, Zagat wrote that B&H; offers "more cameras than the paparazzi at the Oscars", with "cordial" staffers who "know their stuff".
