B minor is a minor scale based on B, consisting of the pitches B, C, D, E, F, G, and A. Its key signature has two sharps. Its relative major is D major and its parallel major is B major. The B natural minor scale is: : { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \relative c' { \clef treble \key b \minor \time 7/4 b4^\markup "B natural minor scale" cis d e fis g a b a g fis e d cis b2 \clef bass \key b \minor } } Changes needed for the melodic and harmonic versions of the scale are written in with accidentals as necessary. The B harmonic minor and melodic minor scales are: : { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \relative c' { \clef treble \key b \minor \time 7/4 b4^\markup "B harmonic minor scale" cis d e fis g ais b ais g fis e d cis b2 } } : { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \relative c' { \clef treble \key b \minor \time 7/4 b4^\markup "B melodic minor scale (ascending and descending)" cis d e fis gis ais b a! g! fis e d cis b2 } } Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart (1739–1791) regarded B minor as a key expressing a quiet acceptance of fate and very gentle complaint, something commentators find to be in line with Bach's use of the key in his St John Passion. By the end of the Baroque era, however, conventional academic views of B minor had shifted: Composer-theorist Francesco Galeazzi (1758–1819) opined that B minor was not suitable for music in good taste. Beethoven labelled a B-minor melodic idea in one of his sketchbooks as a "black key". == Notable compositions in B minor == * Johann Sebastian Bach ** Mass in B minor ** Orchestral Suite No. 2, BWV 1067 ** Prelude and Fugue in B minor, BWV 544 ** French Suite No. 3, BWV 814 ** Partita No. 1 in B minor, BWV 1002 ** Flute Sonata in B minor, BWV 1030 * Johannes Brahms ** Clarinet Quintet * Alexander Borodin ** Symphony No. 2 * Frédéric Chopin ** Scherzo No. 1, Op. 20 ** Étude, Op. 25, No. 10 ** Prelude in B minor "Tolling Bells", Op. 28, No. 6 ** Piano Sonata No. 3, Op. 58 ** Waltz, Op. 69, No. 2 * Antonín Dvořák ** Cello Concerto, Op. 104 * Johann Nepomuk Hummel ** Piano Concerto No. 3, Op. 89 * Franz Liszt ** Piano Sonata * Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart ** Adagio, K. 540 * Niccolò Paganini ** Violin Concerto No. 2, Op. 7 *Sergei Rachmaninoff ** Moments musicaux No. 3, Op. 16 ** Prelude in B minor, Op. 32, No. 10 ** Études-Tableaux No. 4 in B minor, Op. 39 * Camille Saint-Saëns ** Violin Concerto No. 3, Op. 61 * Franz Schubert ** Symphony No. 8 (Unfinished), D. 759 * Alexander Scriabin ** Fantaisie in B minor, Op. 28 * Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky ** Symphony No. 6 (Pathetique), Op. 74 ==See also== *Key (music) *Major and minor *Chord (music) *Chord names and symbols (popular music) == References == Notes Sources * See also Francesco Galeazzi, The Theoretical-Practical Elements of Music, Parts III and IV; English translation, with introduction and commentary, by Deborah Burton and Gregory W.
