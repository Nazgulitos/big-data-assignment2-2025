BBNG is the debut album from Canadian jazz instrumental hip hop band BADBADNOTGOOD. It was released as a free download in 2011. The album features a mixture of original compositions and covers of songs from the artists Flying Lotus, Gang Starr, J Dilla, Joy Division, Nas and Ol' Dirty Bastard. The cover artwork was designed and made by Connor Olthuis and Sam Zaret. == Release and reception == After putting out a series of covers, as well as the original track "Salmonella," in mid-2011, the band released their debut album BBNG for free on their Bandcamp page in September 2011. The album circulated around the blogosphere and was championed by tastemakers DJ Gilles Peterson and critic Anthony Fantano of The Needle Drop. Peterson would go on to invite them to play at his Worldwide Awards in London in January 2012. In a positive review of the album, Fantano complemented their fusion of hip hop, electronic, and jazz traditions and said that the group "show a lot of great musicianship... and they just play off each other so well." However, he wished that the record was a bit more focused and contained more original material. The album was quickly followed by two live albums, BBNGLIVE 1 and BBNGLIVE 2, released in November 2011 and February 2012, respectively. ==Track listing== Credits adapted from Bandcamp. ==Personnel== Credits sourced from Bandcamp.
