The BBC Big Screens are LED screens with sound systems situated in prominent locations in city centres in the United Kingdom. The project setting up these screens involved the BBC, LOCOG (London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games), and local councils. The premise on which the screens are operated is as a platform for all, to provide local information, and to allow filmmakers and other visual artists a platform on which to display their work. There are 21 Big Screens in cities across the UK. Between 2002 and 2013 the BBC operated these screens, but the BBC department to manage the screens centrally closed in 2013 following funding cuts. Since 2013, some of the screens have been decommissioned, and some have been transferred to local authority ownership, where they continue to operate. == Locations == === Belfast === Big Screen Belfast is in Donegall Square in the grounds of Belfast City Hall, and was installed in May 2011, the first Big Screen in Northern Ireland. In 2013 ownership of the screen transferred to Belfast City Council, but it was put up for auction in 2017 due to council funding cuts. === Birmingham === The Big Screen was temporarily installed adjacent to the Birmingham Town Hall during its refurbishment. The Big Screen in Birmingham was removed from Chamberlain Square on 19 September 2007 after the renovation of the Town Hall was completed. It was then erected in Victoria Square in November 2007. Some controversy has existed over the screen in terms of the number of objections to the renewal of its planning permission. Three years after it was due to be switched back on it had finally been fully activated. However, funding was cut by the BBC and the Big Screen was switched off on 10 December 2012, Birmingham City Council have yet to remove the screen due to budget cuts themselves. === Bradford === Big Screen Bradford is situated in Centenary Square, at the heart of Bradford City Centre.

At the end of 2012, the Screen was gifted to Bristol City Council, who then gifted it to We The Curious.
