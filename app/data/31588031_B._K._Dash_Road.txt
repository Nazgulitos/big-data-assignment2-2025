Dilip Kumar Das is the owner by inheritance. He is the grandson of Ashutosh Das. Some part of the structure has become unstable, due to low maintenance. The front elevation of the Mansion has two balconies overlooking the street. There was an elongated balcony between the two existing ones however, during the 1971 war with Pakistan, the balcony gets demolished due to the fire ignited by the Pakistani troops. In an interview with a prestigious newspaper, a local named 'Taimur' said, "In Dhaka, during 1971, this was an extremely rare building where the Hindu property owner did not let go of the ownership. The mansion fell victim to arson attack. The balcony collapsed then, and we can still see the charred walls." The estate has a courtyard surrounding which are the rooms of the mansion. The roof of the Putul Bari overlooks the once glorious Buriganga River; it was previously believed that residing along the peripheral of the Buriganga River was a mark of aristocracy. The mansion stands as a proof of the wealth of the zamindar that resided in the neighbourhood of Farashganj and how they preferred ornamenting their mansions by sculpting the walls with intricate designs. === Bibi Ka Rawza === Situated in 11 B.K.
