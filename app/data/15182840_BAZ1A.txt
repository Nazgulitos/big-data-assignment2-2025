Bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger domain protein 1A is a protein that in humans is encoded by the BAZ1A gene. ==Structure== The protein encoded by this gene belongs to a family of proteins which includes BAZ1B, BAZ2A, and BAZ2B. All family members contain the following domains and structural motifs: * N-terminus – PHD finger (C4HC3 zinc finger) * WAKZ motif * LH (leucine-rich helical domain) motif * C-terminus – bromodomain ==Function== BAZ1A along with SMARCA5, POLE3, and CHRAC1 comprise the WCRF/CHRAC ATP-dependent chromatin- remodeling complex. The purified CHRAC complex can mobilize nucleosomes into a regularly spaced nucleosomal array, and the spacing activity is ATP-dependent. Furthermore, the BAZ1A-SMARCA5 complex enables DNA replication through highly condensed regions of chromatin. ==Interactions== BAZ1A has been shown to interact with SMARCA5 and SATB1. ==References== Category:Genes on human chromosome 14
