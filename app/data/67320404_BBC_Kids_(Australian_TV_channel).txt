BBC Kids is an Australian pay television channel using the BBC Kids brand, currently exclusive to Telstra's Fetch TV. The channel is aimed at 6 to 10-year-olds and broadcasts comedy, documentaries, drama, entertainment and nature shows that were originally aired on CBBC in the UK. == History == On 30 April 2020, Disney closed their Australian children's channels (Disney Channel and Disney Junior), and Cartoon Network and Boomerang became bound to an exclusive agreement with Foxtel in 2021. This left Fetch TV with little children's content. In response it commissioned BBC Studios to create a domestic BBC Kids channel. BBC Kids, along with NickMusic, launched on April 24, 2021. The channel complemented an existing CBeebies channel available in Australia, catering to children aged 0 to 6. == Programming == The shows broadcast on the channel are as follows: === Current programming === * Deadly 60 on a Mission * Horrible Histories * Jamie Johnson * Leonardo * M.I. High * Project Parent * Super Human Challenge * The Dumping Ground * The Next Step * The Sarah Jane Adventures === Upcoming programming === * Blue Peter ==References== ==External links== * Category:Television networks in Australia Category:International BBC television channels Category:Television channels and stations established in 2021 Category:English-language television stations in Australia Category:2021 establishments in Australia Category:BBC Worldwide
