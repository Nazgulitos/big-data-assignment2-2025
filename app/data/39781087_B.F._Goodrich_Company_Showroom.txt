The B.F. Goodrich Company Showroom is a B.F. Goodrich Company showroom located at 1925 S. Michigan Ave. in Chicago's Motor Row District. The showroom was built in 1911 to sell B.F. Goodrich tires and distribute them to other Chicago retailers. Christian Albert Eckstorm, a Chicago architect who designed many of the Motor Row showrooms, designed the building. The Second Empire building features a mansard roof with a terra cotta balustrade, three dormers with terra cotta frames, a partial cornice, and large second-story windows with arched lintels. Like most Motor Row buildings, its architectural ornaments are primarily located near the top of the building. B.F. Goodrich used the showroom until 1929. The showroom was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 28, 2009. ==References== Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1911 Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Chicago Category:Second Empire architecture in Illinois Category:1911 establishments in Illinois
