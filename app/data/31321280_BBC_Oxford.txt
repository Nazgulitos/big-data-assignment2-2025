BBC Oxford is the name given to the sub-opt out region serving Oxford and the surrounding areas. Its services include: *BBC Oxford News, the local news service called BBC Oxford on screen *BBC Radio Oxford, the local radio station occasionally branded as BBC Oxford 95.2FM. ==Creation== The region was created following the splitting up of the former BBC South East region to form BBC London, the current BBC South East region and a smaller service for Oxford that would be an opt out from South Today. In December 2022 this opt-out was abolished, with all news services for the area being broadcast from the Southampton studios. This has inevitably greatly reduced news stories from the Oxford area.
