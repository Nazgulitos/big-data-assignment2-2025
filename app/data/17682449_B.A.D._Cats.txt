B.A.D. Cats is an American action/police drama that aired on ABC from January until February 1980 on Friday nights at 8 PM Eastern time. The series stars Asher Brauner, Steve Hanks, and Michelle Pfeiffer in one of her first major acting roles. The acronym B.A.D. Cats stood for 'Burglary Auto Detail, Commercial Auto Thefts'. ==Synopsis== Nick Donovan (Brauner) and Ocee James (Hanks) were two former race car drivers who joined the LAPD as part of the B.A.D. C.A.T. squad (which stood for Burglary Auto Detail Commercial Auto Thefts). Using their superior driving skills, the two mainly saw fit to run the bad guys off the road rather than question them. Their superior, Captain Nathan (Vic Morrow) publicly chastised the two, but privately encouraged their "loose cannon" style. Officer Samantha Jensen (Pfeiffer) would occasionally lend a hand when a more feminine approach was called for. Also seen were Ma (LaWanda Page), who owned a bar which the boys frequented, and Rodney (Jimmie Walker), a former car thief trying to get on the straight and narrow. ==Cast== * Asher Brauner as Officer Nick Donovan * Steve Hanks as Officer Ocee James * Vic Morrow as Captain Eugene Nathan * LaWanda Page as Ma * Michelle Pfeiffer as Samantha "Sunshine" Jensen * Penny Santon as Mrs. Bernardi * Jimmie Walker as Rodney Washington ==Episodes== ==External links== * Category:1980 American television series debuts Category:1980 American television series endings Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming Category:1980s American crime drama television series Category:American action television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Fictional portrayals of the Los Angeles Police Department Category:Television series by Spelling Television Category:Television shows set in Los Angeles
