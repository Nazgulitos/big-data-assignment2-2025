When the private aircraft carrying Maxwell and Kenboya to Zambezi was struck by a lightning and crashed at the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, the two injured men took refuge in the cavern home of a mutant red gorilla. While drinking rainwater that had been filtered through the cavern's mineral laden walls, Maxwell suddenly found he was growing larger, stronger and more ferocious, and was able to subdue the attacking red ape with ease. Acknowledging Maxwell as its master, the red gorilla retrieved an ancient Corinthian styled helmet from the depths of the cave and placed it on Maxwell's head. Through the helmet, Maxwell was able to read the red gorilla's mind and discovered its name was Djuba. He also discovered that the helmet enabled him to control the actions of all other animals.
