Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the BAIAP2 gene. == Function == The protein encoded by this gene has been identified as a brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor (BAI1)-binding protein. This interaction at the cytoplasmic membrane is crucial to the function of this protein, which may be involved in neuronal growth-cone guidance. This protein functions as an insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate and suggests a role for insulin in the central nervous system. This protein has also been identified as interacting with the dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy gene, which is associated with an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease. It also associates with a downstream effector of Rho small G proteins, which is associated with the formation of stress fibers and cytokinesis. Alternative splicing of the 3'-end of this gene results in three products of undetermined function. ==Interactions== BAIAP2 has been shown to interact with: * ATN1, * CDC42, * EPS8, * RAC1, * SHANK1, * WASF1, and * WASF2. ==References== ==External links== * ==Further reading== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
