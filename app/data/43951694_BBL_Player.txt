BBL Player, formerly known as BBL TV, is an English subscription-based internet television channel, operated by British Basketball League (BBL), which is available internationally through the league's official website. ==History== The launch of BBL TV was first announced on 19 August 2013, after nine months of development. The online subscription-based service was scheduled to broadcast 30 live games throughout the 2013–14 season, starting with Glasgow Rocks against Surrey United on 6 October at the Emirates Arena. On top of the live broadcast's, the service included an archive library allowing viewers to watch previously broadcast games. Due to the success and popularity of BBL TV, the service returned for the 2014–15 season with additions to the coverage including more pre and post match analysis and an 'in-play forum' allowing fans to connect and discuss the action as it happens. The number of games to be broadcast for 2014–15 was also expanded to 45 following the announcement of Sportradar as the BBL's official betting data partner for the season. ==Presenters and commentators== *Daniel Routledge, regular presenter and commentator *Vince Macaulay, regular commentator *Rob Paternostro, guest commentator *Mark Woods, court-side reporter ==See also== *British Basketball League ==References== Category:British Basketball League Category:Sports television in the United Kingdom Category:2013 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Television channels and stations established in 2013 Category:Internet television channels
