The B.C. Open was a PGA Tour golf tournament in New York, held annually from 1971 to 2006. In 1971, it was called the Broome County Open, and the next year it switched to the B.C. Open. In 1973, it became a PGA Tour regular 72-hole money event. From 2000 to 2006, it took place during the same week as The Open Championship, so the leading players were not available and it was one of the smaller events on the PGA Tour schedule. The purse for the final edition in 2006 was $3 million. The tournament was played at the En-Joie Golf Course in Endicott in Upstate New York for every event through 2005. In 2006, severe flooding of the adjacent Susquehanna River forced the event to move to the Atunyote Golf Club at the Turning Stone Resort & Casino in Verona. The event was operated by Broome County Community Charities, Inc. Since its inception, the B.C. Open has turned back to local charities in excess of $7.4 million through 2003. It was named after the comic strip B.C., created by Johnny Hart, who was born and raised in Endicott. Johnny Hart's B.C. characters were used in advertising the event. The B.C. Open was held for the last time on the PGA Tour in 2006 due to a schedule revamp based on the introduction of the FedEx Cup.PGA TOUR unveils inaugural FedEx Cup schedule The success of the Turning Stone event in 2006 led to that venue hosting a "Fall Series" event beginning in 2007, the Turning Stone Resort Championship. The Broome County Community Charities has hosted a Champions Tour event at the En-Joie Golf Course beginning in 2007, the Dick's Sporting Goods Open.Champions Tour to come to site of B.C.
