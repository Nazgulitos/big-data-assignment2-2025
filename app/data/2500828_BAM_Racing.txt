BAM Racing was a NASCAR racing team based in Charlotte, North Carolina, owned by Beth Ann and Tony Morgenthau. The team began racing in the ARCA RE/MAX Series in 2000 before moving to NASCAR in 2001. They sat out 2009 due to the recession, and have not raced since. ==Sprint Cup Series== ===Car No. 49 history=== BAM Racing attempted its first Cup race at the Talladega 500 in 2001 with Andy Hillenburg, but failed to qualify. They also attempted the Pepsi 400, Pennsylvania 500 and the Brickyard 400 with Hillenburg, as well as the Pennzoil Freedom 400 with Rich Bickle, but did not qualify for any of those races. BAM switched to Dodge for 2002, and acquired equipment from American Equipment Racing owner Buz McCall, who also provided the shop for use. The team qualified for the 2002 Daytona 500 with Shawna Robinson as its driver, who was scheduled to compete in 24 races. However, she struggled and her last race for the season was at the second Daytona race where she would finish 40th. Kevin Lepage, Stuart Kirby, Ron Hornaday, Stacy Compton and Derrike Cope would finish out the season with a best finish of 22nd at Talladega. For the 2003 season it was announced that Ken Schrader would drive the No. 49. The team was forced to run with multiple sponsors throughout the year but most of the year the car was sponsored by AT&T; through its 1-800-CALL-ATT collect call service. The team qualified for 32 races and had a best finish of 8th at Michigan. In 2004, it was announced BAM Racing had secured a deal with Schwan Food Company for multiple years. They were able to achieve a best finish of 6th during the season, had three less DNF's, and improved their average finish by two places. Schwan's and Schrader again returned for the 2005 season and BAM had its best season to date with three top tens and an average finish of 25th place. After the conclusion of the 2005 season, Ken Schrader left to join Wood Brothers/JTG Racing. For 2006, Schrader was replaced by Brent Sherman who brought along sponsorship from Serta Mattresses. Sherman was to run for the Rookie of the Year award. However, after struggling through the start of the season he was released in favor of veteran Jimmy Spencer. Spencer was also be an advisor for BAM and was a mentor for Sherman during his time there. However, Sherman's departure from the team left it unsponsored, as Serta had followed Sherman from ARCA racing to Busch Series and Cup series racing. Spencer raced from the spring Martinsville race until the spring Richmond race, when Mike Wallace took over. In May 2006, Kevin Lepage left Front Row Motorsports to take over the No. 49, before he was replaced by Mike Bliss in October. Chris Cook was hired to drive for the team to run the road course events, but failed to qualify for both events. In 2007, BAM Racing was to race with Mike Bliss as the driver, using Evernham engines, but Bliss failed to qualify for 11 out of 15 attempts, and resigned midway through the season. Chad Chaffin was the team's interim driver at Loudon and Chicagoland, and Larry Foyt racing at Daytona. In the team's first attempt to qualify after Bliss' resignation at Loudon, Chaffin made the race after Brian Vickers and the No. 83 Team Red Bull Toyota were disqualified after failing post-qualifying inspection. Journeyman road racer Klaus Graf attempted several races in the No. 49, but didn't qualify for any of them due to engine blowups and a rain shower cancelling qualifying. Bliss briefly returned for a few races, before journeyman John Andretti was hired to complete the rest of the season for BAM. John Andretti was signed to drive the full 2008 season, but the contract was nullified just days before 2008 Daytona testing to put Ken Schrader in the seat in hopes of attracting more sponsorship.Ken Schrader and the BAM team failed to qualify for the Daytona 500 and the following race at California Speedway. Schrader drove in the Budweiser Shootout, but failed to qualify for the first two races of the season.thumb|right|2008 Daytona 500. The team switched from Dodge to Toyota before the Goody's Cool Orange 500, along with announcing Microsoft's Small Business division as their sponsor. BAM promptly announced that they would be withdrawing from the next two races at Texas and Phoenix to refocus the team's efforts. Both the expenses of switching manufacturers and the pullout of Microsoft to Michael Waltrip Racing have forced BAM Racing to push their scheduled return further back, with NASCAR.com reporting on April 15, 2008, that the team may not return to racing until the fall. However, BAM made a minor attempt at a comeback in the Sprint All-Star Race. BAM fielded a ride for Petty Enterprises developmental driver Chad McCumbee, the car was a Dodge with sponsorship from Marathon Oil. McCumbee finished 13th. On July 11, 2008, Sports Illustrated reported that BAM Racing was in talks with Barack Obama regarding a one-race sponsorship at Pocono, through BAM spokesman Rhett Vandiver. However, Obama spokesman Bill Burton told Yahoo! Sports that the sponsorship would not happen. The team took the 2009 season off due to the economy and its unwillingness to be a start and park operation. Warner Music Nashville announced a strategic marketing alliance that gave WMN exclusive promotional opportunities with the NASCAR Sprint Cup racing team. Under the agreement, WMN artists had the opportunity to participate in branding and promotional programs at NASCAR events. The team planned to attempt a full schedule in 2010 with the new partnership and to run Toyotas. Larry the Cable Guy was to be featured on the car for the Daytona 500, with WMN artists Blake Shelton, Whitney Duncan, Gloriana, Jessica Harp, Jason Jones and James Otto joining the team for later races.http://www.nascar.com/2010/news/headlines/cup/01/07/bam.racing.vip.artists/ BAM announces additional VIP artists On January 8, the team announced it would align with Robby Gordon and his self-owned team for the 2010 season. The join contract stated that RGM/BAM would have at least one car present at each race and would jointly field Gordon's No. 7 Toyota at certain races with sponsorship from WMN. Although it was announced that BAM would field the #49 car alongside the #7 after the Daytona 500, the #49 car did not show up and Gordon ran the #7 under BAM/Warner sponsorship until the 2010 Coca-Cola 600. BAM was not seen afterwards; it was later announced that the RGM/BAM partnership had dissolved and that RGM is exploring taking legal action against BAM Racing and Warner Music Nashville. The team made no further attempts for the remainder of 2010. In September 2019, former American Equipment Racing owner Buz McCall confirmed in an interview with a fan that BAM is now defunct.(9) ====Car No. 49 results==== NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results NASCAR Sprint Cup Series results Year Driver No. Make 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 Pts 2001 Andy Hillenburg 49 Pontiac DAY CAR LVS ATL DAR BRI TEX MAR TAL DNQ CAL RCH CLT DOV MCH POC SON DAY DNQ CHI NHA POC DNQ IND DNQ GLN MCH BRI DAR RCH DOV KAN CLT MAR TAL PHO CAR N/A - 2001 Rich Bickle 49 Chevy HOM DNQ ATL NHA N/A - 2002 Shawna Robinson 49 Dodge DAY 24 CAR LVS 42 ATL 34 DAR 42 BRI TEX 36 MAR TAL DNQ CAL 42 RCH DAY 40 41st 1004 2002 Ron Hornaday Jr. 49 Dodge CLT 36 DOV POC MCH SON CHI DNQ NHA POC IND DNQ GLN 41st 1004 2002 Derrike Cope 49 Dodge MCH 37 BRI 41 DAR RCH NHA ATL 37 CAR PHO 38 HOM 34 41st 1004 2002 Kevin Lepage 49 Dodge DOV 36 41st 1004 2002 Stuart Kirby 49 Dodge KAN 37 41st 1004 2002 Stacy Compton 49 Dodge TAL 22 CLT 42 MAR 41st 1004 2003 Ken Schrader 49 Dodge DAY 42 CAR 24 LVS 28 ATL 38 DAR 17 BRI 37 TEX 24 TAL 33 MAR 10 CAL 30 RCH 24 CLT 28 DOV 26 POC 43 MCH 42 SON 33 DAY 41 CHI 28 NHA 36 POC 26 IND DNQ GLN DNQ MCH 8 BRI 12 DAR 38 RCH 25 NHA 37 DOV 33 TAL 21 KAN 28 CLT DNQ MAR 22 ATL 26 PHO 27 CAR 36 HOM DNQ 38th 2569 2004 Ken Schrader 49 Dodge DAY 40 CAR 27 LVS 32 ATL 26 DAR 22 BRI 6 TEX 19 MAR 40 TAL 23 CAL 20 RCH 23 CLT 31 DOV 34 POC 25 MCH 39 SON 23 DAY 35 CHI 27 NHA 37 POC 21 IND 18 GLN 28 MCH 28 BRI 32 CAL 33 RCH 30 NHA 16 DOV 25 TAL 20 KAN 27 CLT 21 MAR 31 ATL 23 PHO 20 DAR 30 HOM 25 33rd 3032 2005 Ken Schrader 49 Dodge DAY 39 CAL 14 LVS 34 ATL 26 BRI 23 MAR 24 TEX 23 PHO 38 TAL 8 DAR 18 RCH 30 CLT 9 DOV 37 POC 20 MCH 28 SON 35 DAY 10 CHI 26 NHA 26 POC 31 IND 22 GLN 32 MCH 25 BRI 11 CAL 29 RCH 19 NHA 40 DOV 28 TAL 26 KAN 17 CLT 34 MAR 13 ATL 34 TEX 29 PHO 30 HOM 22 31st 3159 2006 Brent Sherman 49 Dodge DAY 21 CAL 37 LVS 34 ATL 36 BRI 42 TEX DNQ PHO 32 TAL DNQ 40th 1865 2006 Jimmy Spencer 49 Dodge MAR 40th 1865 2006 Mike Wallace 49 Dodge RCH 35 40th 1865 2006 Kevin Lepage 49 Dodge DAR 36 CLT DNQ DOV 39 POC 31 MCH 34 DAY DNQ CHI DNQ NHA 30 POC 34 IND DNQ MCH 41 BRI 21 CAL 38 RCH 33 NHA 30 DOV 37 KAN DNQ 40th 1865 2006 Chris Cook 49 Dodge SON DNQ GLN DNQ 40th 1865 2006 Mike Bliss 49 Dodge TAL 26 CLT 42 MAR DNQ ATL 26 TEX 23 PHO 41 HOM 39 40th 1865 2007 Mike Bliss 49 Dodge DAY DNQ CAL DNQ LVS DNQ ATL 21 BRI 17 MAR 30 TEX 41 PHO DNQ TAL DNQ RCH DNQ DAR DNQ CLT DNQ DOV DNQ POC DNQ MCH DNQ POC DNQ 47th 1502 2007 Klaus Graf 49 Dodge SON DNQ GLN DNQ 47th 1502 2007 Chad Chaffin 49 Dodge NHA 36 CHI 31 47th 1502 2007 Larry Foyt 49 Dodge DAY DNQ 47th 1502 2007 Ken Schrader 49 Dodge IND 25 1502 2007 John Andretti 49 Dodge MCH 37 BRI 40 CAL 37 RCH 37 NHA DNQ DOV 37 KAN 33 TAL 33 CLT 42 MAR 33 ATL 28 TEX DNQ PHO DNQ HOM DNQ 47th 1502 2008 Ken Schrader 49 Dodge DAY DNQ CAL DNQ LVS 21 ATL DNQ BRI 41 48th 276 2008 Ken Schrader 49 Toyota MAR 37 TEX PHO TAL RCH DAR CLT DOV POC MCH SON NHA DAY CHI IND POC GLN MCH BRI CAL RCH NHA DOV KAN TAL CLT MAR ATL TEX PHO HOM 48th 276 2010 David Gilliland 49 Toyota DAY DNQ CAL LVS ATL BRI MAR PHO TEX TAL RCH DAR DOV CLT POC MCH SON NHA DAY CHI IND POC GLN MCH BRI ATL RCH NHA DOV KAN CAR CLT MAR TAL TEX PHO HOM N/A - ===Car Nos. 59 and 70 history=== The team fielded a second car for Klaus Graf at Infineon in 2004, the No. 59 SEM Products/Color Horizons Dodge. He finished 17th. The team attempted a number of races later in the year, but failed to qualify for all of them. Larry Foyt also attempted a number of races late in the 2004 season, instead running the No. 70 due to the system of the 2004 provisional points. The team shut down at the conclusion of the 2004 season. Before shutting down, the team was looking to run a second or even a third car in 2005 but sponsorship never materialized. ====Car No. 59/70 results==== NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results NASCAR Nextel Cup Series results Year Driver No. Make 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 Pts 2004 Klaus Graf 59 Dodge DAY CAR LVS ATL DAR BRI TEX MAR TAL CAL RCH CLT DOV POC MCH SON 17 DAY CHI NHA POC IND GLN DNQ MCH BRI CAL RCH NHA DOV TAL KAN MAR DNQ 61st 188 2004 Larry Foyt 59 Dodge CLT DNQ ATL DNQ PHO DAR HOM 61st 188 2004 Larry Foyt 70 Dodge DAY CAR LVS ATL DAR BRI TEX MAR TAL CAL RCH CLT DOV POC MCH SON DAY CHI NHA POC IND GLN MCH BRI CAL RCH NHA DOV TAL KAN CLT MAR ATL PHO DAR HOM DNQ N/A - ==ARCA Re/Max Series== ===Car No. 49 history=== The team was created in 2000 from the remnants of the ISM Racing that was not being used by Tyler Jet Motorsports.
