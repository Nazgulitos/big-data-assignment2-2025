The 'b' Album is a collection of B-sides and rarities released in 1996 by the Canadian folk band Moxy Früvous. A sticker on the packaging warned, "Not the third album!" At first self-published by the band, it was rereleased later that year with a revised track order in Canada by Warner Music Canada, and in the United States by Bottom Line Records. ==Track listing (Warner version)== # "I Love My Boss" # "The Greatest Man in America" (live) # "Johnny Saucep'n" # "Ash Hash" (by Bob Snider) # "Gord's Gold" # "Big Fish" # "Jenny Washington" # "The Ballad of Cedric Früvous" # "Entropy" # "The Kids' Song" (live) ==External links== *Album information page at fruvous.com Category:Moxy Früvous albums Category:1996 EPs
