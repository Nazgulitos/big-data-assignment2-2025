In biology, the BBCH-scale for faba beans describes the phenological development of faba beans using the BBCH-scale. The phenological growth stages and BBCH-identification keys of faba beans are: Growth stage Code Description 0: Germination 00 Dry seed 01 Beginning of seed imbibition 03 Seed imbibition complete 05 Radicle emerged from seed 07 Shoot emerged from seed (plumule apparent) 08 Shoot growing towards soil surface 09 Emergence: shoot emerges through soil surface 1: Leaf development1 10 Pair of scale leaves visible (may be eaten or lost) 11 First leaf unfolded 12 2 leaves unfolded 13 3 leaves unfolded 1 . Stages continuous till ... 19 9 or more leaves unfolded 2: Formation of side shoots 20 No side shoots 21 Beginning of side shoot development: first side shoot detectable 22 2 side shoots detectable 23 3 side shoots detectable 2 . Stages continuous till ... 29 End of side shoot development: 9 or more side shoots detectable 3: Stem elongation 30 Beginning of stem elongation 31 One visibly extended internode2 32 2 visibly extended internodes 33 3 visibly extended internodes 3 . Stages continuous till ... 39 9 or more visibly extended internodes 5: Inflorescence emergence 50 Flower buds present, still enclosed by leaves 51 First flower buds visible outside leaves 55 First individual flower buds visible outside leaves but still closed 59 First petals visible, many individual flower buds, still closed 6: Flowering 60 First flowers open 61 Flowers open on first raceme 63 Flowers open 3 racemes per plant 65 Full flowering: flowers open on 5 racemes per plant 67 Flowering declining 69 End of flowering 7: Development of fruit 70 First pods have reached final length (“flat pod”) 71 10% of pods have reached final length 72 20% of pods have reached final length 73 30% of pods have reached final length 74 40% of pods have reached final length 75 50% of pods have reached final length 76 60% of pods have reached final length 77 70% of pods have reached final length 78 80% of pods have reached final length 79 Nearly all pods have reached final length 8: Ripening 80 Beginning of ripening: seed green, filling pod cavity 81 10% of pods ripe, seeds dry and hard 82 20% of pods ripe, seeds dry and hard 83 30% of pods ripe and dark, seeds dry and hard 84 40% of pods ripe and dark, seeds dry and hard 85 50% of pods ripe and dark, seeds dry and hard 86 60% of pods ripe and dark, seeds dry and hard 87 70% of pods ripe and dark, seeds dry and hard 88 80% of pods ripe and dark, seeds dry and hard 89 Fully ripe: nearly all pods dark, seeds dry and hard 9: Senescence 93 Stems begin to darken 95 50% of stems brown or black 97 Plant dead and dry 99 Harvested product 1 Stem elongation may occur earlier than stage 19; in this case continue with the principal stage 3 2 First internode extends from the scale leaf node to the first true leaf node ==References== * * Category:BBCH-scale
