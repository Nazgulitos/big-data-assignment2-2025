BC School Sports is the governing body for high school athletics in the province of British Columbia, Canada. It was originally organized in 1965 as the British Columbia Federation of School Athletic Associations (BCFSAA) by a group of interested teachers and administrators. A Constitution was adopted in 1966. Jim Stewart of Coquitlam was the first President. Stewart was elected to the BC School Sports Honour Roll in 1993. Operational support was received from the provincial government (but Provincial support was withdrawn in 2009). During a special general meeting in October 2009, the membership voted to increase fees up to 75% to offset the cost of the provincial government's elimination of funding. == History == The association opened an office on January 1970, with Executive Secretary Don Steen as the first employee.
