The 100 Greatest TV Series of the 21st Century is a list compiled in October 2021 by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), as part of their annual critics' poll, chosen by a voting poll of 206 television experts (critics, journalists, academics and industry figures) from 43 countries. ==Statistics== It was compiled by collating the top ten series submitted by the experts who were asked to list the best series that began airing since the year 2000. Television that began in the 20th century but continued airing in the 21st century weren't eligible for inclusion (e.g. Doctor Who, South Park, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and The Sopranos). The third season of Twin Peaks (subtitled "The Return") is eligible due to it being commissioned as a stand-alone miniseries as opposed to a revival of the original series. Breaking Bad (#3) and The Good Wife (#33) are the only programmes to also have spin-off series place on the list, with Better Call Saul (#23) and The Good Fight (#47), respectively. Only 7 programmes did not fall under the scripted live action genre; four animated shows — BoJack Horseman (#11), Avatar: The Last Airbender (#61), Rick and Morty (#76) and Steven Universe (#99) — and three non-fiction shows — the reality competition series RuPaul's Drag Race (#67) plus the non- fiction docuseries Planet Earth (#73) & the Academy Award-winning O.J.: Made in America (#81).100 Greatest TV Series of the 21st Century Revealed|Digital Trends Damon Lindelof is the creator with the most shows on the list with three; The Leftovers (#7); Lost (#19) and Watchmen (#26).BBC Culture Names 'The Wire' the Best Series of the 21st Century - IndieWire ==Process== BBC Culture asked 206 television experts from around the world to rank the ten television programs produced in the twenty-first century that they considered the greatest.Why The Wire is the greatest TV series of the 21st Century - BBC CultureGame of Thrones, Money Heist, Breaking Bad among BBC’s top 100 tv series of 21st century|Financial Express Participants were permitted to choose from titles released between January 2000 to July 2021 (when all responses were collected).
