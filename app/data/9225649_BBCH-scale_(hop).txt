In biology, the BBCH-scale for hops describes the phenological development of Humulus lupulus (hops) using the BBCH-scale. The phenological growth stages and BBCH-identification keys of hops are: Growth stage Code Description 0: Sprouting 00 Dormancy: rootstock without shoots (uncut) 01 Dormancy: rootstock without shoots (cut) 07 Rootstock with shoots (uncut) 08 Beginning of shoot- growth (rootstock cut) 09 Emergence: first shoots emerge at the soil surface 1: Leaf development 11 First pair of leaves unfolded 12 2nd pair of leaves unfolded (beginning of twining) 13 3rd pair of leaves unfolded 1 . Stages continuous till ... 19 9 and more pairs of leaves unfolded 2: Formation of side shoots 21 First pair of side shoots visible 22 2nd pair of side shoots visible 23 3rd pair of side shoots visible 2 . Stages continuous till ... 29 Nine and more pairs of side shoots visible (secondary side shoots occur) 3: Elongation of bines 31 Bines have reached 10% of top wire height 32 Bines have reached 20% of top wire height 33 Bines have reached 30% of top wire height 3 . Stages continuous till ... 38 Plants have reached the top wire 39 End of bine growth 5: Inflorescence emergence 51 Inflorescence buds visible 55 Inflorescence buds enlarged 6: Flowering 61 Beginning of flowering: about 10% of flowers open 62 About 20% of flowers open 63 About 30% of flowers open 64 About 40% of flowers open 65 Full flowering: about 50% of flowers open 66 About 60% of flowers open 67 About 70% of flowers open 68 About 80% of flowers open 69 End of flowering 7: Development of cones 71 Beginning of cone development: 10% of inflorescences are cones 75 Cone development half way: all cones visible, cones soft, stigmas still present 79 Cone development complete: nearly all cones have reached full size 8: Maturity of cones 81 Beginning of maturity: 10% of cones are compact 82 20% of cones are compact 83 30% of cones are compact 84 40% of cones are compact 85 Advanced maturity: 50% of cones are compact 86 60% of cones are compact 87 70% of cones are compact 88 80% of cones are compact 89 Cones ripe for picking: cones closed; lupulin golden; aroma potential fully developed 9: Senescence, entry into dormancy 92 Overripeness: cones yellow-brown discoloured, aroma deterioration 97 Dormancy: leaves and stems dead ==References== * Category:BBCH-scale Category:Humulus
