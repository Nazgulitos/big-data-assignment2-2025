B-7 Pillar () is located in the Lewis Range, Glacier National Park in the U.S. state of Montana. The summit is located just northeast of Iceberg Peak, and one-half mile east of the Continental Divide. ==Climate== Based on the Köppen climate classification, it is located in an alpine subarctic climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and cool to warm summers. Temperatures can drop below −10 °F with wind chill factors below −30 °F. ==Geology== Like other mountains in Glacier National Park, it is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was initially uplifted beginning 170 million years ago when the Lewis Overthrust fault pushed an enormous slab of precambrian rocks thick, wide and long over younger rock of the cretaceous period. == Gallery == File:B-7 Pillar in Glacier National Park.jpg|B-7 Pillar right of center, Iceberg Peak to left File:Iceberg Lake Trail - Glacier National Park.jpg|B-7 Pillar upper right, Iceberg Peak to left File:Unnamed Pillar.jpg|B-7 Pillar, southeast face File:Mount Wilbur - Ptarmigan Wall.jpg|Mount Wilbur (left) - Iceberg Peak - B-7 Pillar (right).
